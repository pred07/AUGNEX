IMINT involves analyzing photos and videos to determine **Where** and **When** they were taken. This skill is critical for verifying news, tracking troop movements, or locating a cybercriminal.\n\n### Learning Objectives\n*   Identify geographic clues (Flora, Architecture, Signage, Sun/Shadows).\n*   Use **SunCalc** to determine time of day.\n*   Master **Google Earth Pro** 3D view and historical imagery.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Core Content\n\n### The Methodology\n1.  **Macro:** Continent/Country (look at plugs, driving side, language).\n2.  **Meso:** City/Region (look at mountains, skylines, specific transit maps).\n3.  **Micro:** Street/Building (look at store names, reflections, street view).\n\n### Shadows & Time\nShadows allow you to determine direction and time.\n*   *Morning:* Shadows point West.\n*   *Evening:* Shadows point East.\n*   *SunCalc.org:* Input date and shadow length to find exact time.\n\n### Tools\n*   **Yandex Images:** Often better reverse image search than Google.\n*   **Google Earth Pro:** The desktop version allows measuring distances and viewing historical satellite data (e.g., \"Was this building here in 2019?\").\n\n---\n\n## 3. Lab: The Vacation Geolocation\n\n### Scenario\nTarget posts a photo of a coffee cup. Background: A specific bridge and a tram.\n\n1.  **Analyze:** Tram is yellow. Bridge is suspension style.\n2.  **Search:** \"Yellow tram suspension bridge city\".\n3.  **Result:** Lisbon, Portugal (25 de Abril Bridge).\n4.  **Pinpoint:** Search Google Street View near the bridge for coffee shops with outdoor seating matching the photo angle.\n5.  **Confirm:** Found \"Lisbon Coffee Co\".\n\n---\n\n## 4. Reflection\n1.  Why is the \"Horizon\" important? (Mountains or skylines on the horizon provide a unique fingerprint that can be matched in Google Earth 3D).\n2.  What is \"Chronolocation\"? (Determining *when* a photo was taken, using weather reports, shadows, or construction progress).\n"

        "content": "# The Dark Web & Tor (Introduction)\n\n## 1. Orientation\n\n### What this module covers\nThis module provides the technical foundation for Dark Web research (before the operational module s-36). It explains **Onion Routing**, **Bridges**, and the difference between Deep Web and Dark Web.\n\n### Learning Objectives\n*   Explain the 3-hop architecture of Tor.\n*   Differentiate Surface vs Deep vs Dark Web.\n*   Install and configure the **Tor Browser** safely.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Core Content\n\n### Definitions\n*   **Surface Web:** Indexed by Google (BBC, Wikipedia).\n*   **Deep Web:** Not indexed. Requires login (Gmail, Banking, Corporate Intranets). 90% of the web.\n*   **Dark Web:** Requires specific software (Tor/I2P) and is encrypted/anonymized.\n\n### How Tor Works (The Onion)\nData is wrapped in 3 layers of encryption.\n1.  **Guard Node:** Peels layer 1. Knows IP.\n2.  **Middle Node:** Peels layer 2. Knows nothing.\n3.  **Exit Node:** Peels layer 3. Sends data to destination.\n\n### Staying Safe\n*   **No Scripts:** Disable JavaScript (Security Level: Safest).\n*   **Window Size:** Do not resize the window (prevents fingerprinting resolution).\n*   **Identity:** Do not log into personal accounts (Facebook/Gmail) over Tor.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Lab: Connection Check\n\n### Task\n1.  **Download:** Tor Browser (from `torproject.org` ONLY).\n2.  **Connect:** Open browser.\n3.  **Verify:** Visit `check.torproject.org`. It should say \"Congratulations. This browser is configured to use Tor.\"\n4.  **Explore:** Visit a Directory like `tor.taxi` (a link aggregator).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Reflection\n1.  Can the ISP see you are using Tor? (Yes. They see encrypted traffic to a Tor Guard Node. They can't see *what* you are doing, but they know *that* you are doing it).\n2.  What is a \"Tor Bridge\"? (A secret entry node used to bypass censorship if the main Guard Nodes are blocked).\n"

        "content": "# Breach Data Analysis\n\n## 1. Orientation\n\n### What this module covers\n\"I've been pwned.\"Breach data (usernames, passwords, PII) is the fuel for credential stuffing and phishing. This module covers how to legally and ethically access breach repositories (DeHashed, HaveIBeenPwned) for defensive purposes.\n\n### Learning Objectives\n*   Search for compromised credentials securely.\n*   Analyze password reuse patterns.\n*   Understand the format of \"Combo Lists\".\n\n---\n\n## 2. Core Content\n\n### The Ecosystem\n1.  **Hack:** Site is breached.\n2.  **Leak:** DB is sold on forums.\n3.  **Aggregation:** Data is indexed by services (DeHashed, IntelX).\n4.  **Reuse:** Attackers try the `email:pass` on banking sites.\n\n### Formats\n*   **SQL Dump:** Full database structure.\n*   **Combo List:** `user@email.com:password123` (Processed for attackers).\n*   **Hash:** `user:5f4dcc3b5aa...` (Needs cracking).\n\n### Defense\nIf you find your CEO's password in a breach:\n1.  **Verify:** Is the password still active?\n2.  **Reset:** Force password change.\n3.  **MFA:** Ensure 2FA is on.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Lab: The Breach Hunt\n\n### Scenario\nInvestigate `target@company.com`.\n\n1.  **HIBP:** `haveibeenpwned.com`. Result: \"Found in Collection #1, LinkedIn 2016\".\n2.  **Analysis:** The user was exposed in 2016.\n3.  **DeHashed (Simulation):** Search email.\n    *   Result: `password: hunter2`.\n4.  **Pivot:** Search for other accounts using `hunter2` (reverse search). Found personal hotmail account.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Reflection\n1.  Why is \"Password Reuse\" the biggest risk? (One breach in a knitting forum can compromise a corporate bank account if the user reuses the password).\n2.  What is \"Credential Stuffing\"? (Automated script trying millions of leaked user/pass combos against a login page).\n"

        "content": "# Effective Documentation & Note Taking\n\n## 1. Orientation\n\n### What this module covers\nInvestigations can take weeks. If you don't document, you forget. If you don't document, it didn't happen in court. This module covers **Hunchly**, **Obsidian**, and **Case Management**.\n\n### Learning Objectives\n*   Automate capture with **Hunchly**.\n*   Structure notes for easy retrieval.\n*   Manage chain-of-custody for web evidence.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Core Content\n\n### The Problem\nScreenshots are easily faked. URLs can change or be deleted (The \"404\" problem).\n\n### Tools\n1.  **Hunchly:** Browser extension that records *everything* (HTML, Screenshots, Timestamps) automatically. It creates a local hash to prove non-tampering.\n2.  **Obsidian/CherryTree:** Hierarchical note taking. Link entities (Person A -> linked to -> Company B).\n\n### Methodology\n*   **Timeline:** Chronological log of actions.\n*   **Entities:** List of Persons, Places, Accounts.\n*   **Analysis:** Your thoughts/hypotheses separate from facts.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Lab: Case File Setup\n\n### Scenario\nStart Case: \"Operation Bluebird\".\n\n1.  **Start Hunchly:** Ensure dashboard is recording.\n2.  **Visit:** Target profile on Twitter.\n3.  **Note:** \"Identified target handle @bluebird. 300 followers.\"\n4.  **Delete:** Target deletes the tweet.\n5.  **Recovery:** Open Hunchly dashboard. View \"History\". The tweet is preserved locally with a timestamp hash.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Reflection\n1.  Why is an \"Archive.org\" link not always enough? (Archive.org honors `robots.txt` and takedown requests. Local evidence is yours).\n2.  What is the \"Bus Factor\"? (If you get hit by a bus, can someone else pick up your investigation from your notes? If not, you failed).\n"

        "content": "# OSINT Tooling (Maltego & SpiderFoot)\n\n## 1. Orientation\n\n### What this module covers\nManual OSINT is slow. Tools automate the collection. **SpiderFoot** handles the broad scan (100+ modules). **Maltego** handles the visual link analysis. This module connects the concepts from s-34 (Link Analysis) specifically to OSINT sources.\n\n### Learning Objectives\n*   Configure **SpiderFoot** scans.\n*   Visualize data in **Maltego**.\n*   Identify the limitations of automated tools.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Core Content\n\n### SpiderFoot\n*   **Function:** Automated reconnaissance.\n*   **Modules:** Checks Blacklists, DNS, Whois, Social Media, Email leaks, etc.\n*   **Output:** Massive CSV/Report. Great for \"Broad\" recon.\n\n### Maltego Community Edition\n*   **Function:** Visual correlation.\n*   **Transforms:** \"To Email\", \"To Phone\", \"To Domain\".\n*   **Power:** Showing relations. (e.g., These 3 domains share the same Google Analytics ID).\n\n### The Workflow\n1.  **Target:** `evil.com`.\n2.  **SpiderFoot:** Run scan. Export results.\n3.  **Maltego:** Import interesting IPs/Emails. Pivot to find hidden infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Lab: The Automated Scan\n\n### Scenario\nTarget: `scanme.nmap.org`.\n\n1.  **SpiderFoot:** Start New Scan. Select \"Passport\" (Passive) modules only.\n2.  **Results:**\n    *   *Hosting:* Linode.\n    *   *Web Server:* Apache.\n    *   *Open Ports:* 80, 22.\n3.  **Analysis:** Standard Linux host.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Reflection\n1.  Why verify automated results? (Tools generate False Positives. SpiderFoot might say \"Email Found: `admin@example.com`\" which is just a placeholder text on the site, not a real email).\n2.  What is \"API Rate Limiting\"? (Tools use APIs. If you don't have paid keys (e.g., Shodan, BuiltWith), the tool will fail or return limited results).\n"
