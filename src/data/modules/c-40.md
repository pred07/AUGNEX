# Building a Purple Team Program

## 1. What this module covers
Moving from "Ad-hoc Execution" to a "Program".

## 2. Why this matters for purple teams
Consistency is quality. Doing it once is an event. Doing it monthly is a capability.

## 3. Core concepts explained clearly

### The Cadence
*   **Weekly**: Atomic Tests (Automated).
*   **Monthly**: One manual Campaign (e.g., "Ransomware Month").
*   **Quarterly**: Full Full-Scale Red Team Operation.

### The Team
*   You don't need a dedicated "Purple Team".
*   You need a "Virtual Team": 1 Red Teamer + 1 Blue Teamer + 1 Manager meeting regularly.

## 4. Validation examples

### Measuring Success (KPIs)
*   **Coverage**: % of MITRE ATT&CK covered. (Goal: Increase).
*   **MTTD**: Detection time. (Goal: Decrease).
*   **Detection Rate**: (Goal: Increase).

## 5. Common gaps and failures
*   **Burnout**: Testing too much, too fast.
*   **Loss of funding**: "We haven't been hacked in 2 years, why do we need this?" -> "We haven't been hacked BECAUSE we do this."

## 6. Key takeaways
*   **Culture**: Build a culture where "Finding a Bug" is celebrated, not punished.
*   **Evolution**: The threats change. The program must change with them.
