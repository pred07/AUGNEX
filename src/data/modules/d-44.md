# Building a Home Lab

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers **Self-Learning**. Building a safe place to fail.

### Fit in the Learning Path
You cannot learn malware analysis on your work laptop. You need a Sandbox.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Virtualization** (VirtualBox / VMware).
*   **Network Segregation** (Safe execution).
*   **Targets** (Metasploitable, DVWA).

---

## 2. Core Content

### The Hardware
*   Old laptop or Desktop with lots of RAM (16GB+).
*   Hypervisor: VirtualBox (Free).

### The Typology
1.  **Attacker VM**: Kali Linux.
2.  **Victim VM**: Windows 10 (Trial mode), Metasploitable (Linux).
3.  **The Network**: "Host-Only Adapter". (Prevents VMs from touching your real Wi-Fi or the Internet). **Crucial for malware**.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Lab Setup
1.  Download VirtualBox.
2.  Download Kali ISO.
3.  Set Network to "NAT Network" (if you want internet) or "Host Only" (Safe mode).
4.  Snapshot everything. (So you can break it and restore).

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Safety**: Why never analyse ransomware with "Bridged Networking"? (Because it will encrypt your Host PC and your family's photos).
2.  **Cloud**: Why use Cloud Labs (AWS)? (Public IP access, scalable resources. But costs money).
3.  **Purpose**: Don't just build it. Use it. Detect your own attacks.

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You have a Hypervisor installed.
2.  You have spun up one Linux and one Windows VM.
3.  You know how to take a **Snapshot**.
