# MITRE ATT&CK for Defenders

## 1. Unit Brief: The Periodic Table of Hacking
MITRE ATT&CK is a knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. It provides a common language.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Boss**: "Are we protected against APT29?"
*   **You**: "Let me map APT29's techniques to our defensive controls using ATT&CK."

## 3. Core Concepts

### Structure
*   **Tactics (The Goal)**: "Initial Access", "Persistence", "Exfiltration". (Columns).
*   **Techniques (The Method)**: "Phishing", "Registry Run Keys". (Cells).
*   **Procedures (The Specifics)**: "APT29 used Tool X via Command Y".

### Usage
*   **Mapping**: "Do we have a detection for T1053 (Scheduled Task)?"
*   **Gap Analysis**: "We are good at detecting Malware (Execution), but bad at detecting Exfiltration."

## 4. Practical Examples

### Creating a Heatmap
1.  Open MITRE Navigator.
2.  Color code every technique you can DETECT in Green.
3.  Color code every technique you can BLOCK in Blue.
4.  The Red areas are your blind spots.

### Emulation
Run Atomic Red Team tests.
*   "Run T1003 (Credential Dumping)".
*   Did the alerting fire?
*   If yes -> Validated.
*   If no -> Gap.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Bingo**: Trying to block "Everything". Focus on the techniques used by Threat Groups targeting your industry.
*   **Tool obsession**: Buying a tool because "It covers T1086". Does it cover it *well*?

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Language**: Use ATT&CK IDs (Txxxx) in reports. It eliminates ambiguity.
*   **Strategy**: Driven by data, not vendor hype.
