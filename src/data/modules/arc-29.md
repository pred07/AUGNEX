## 3. Guided Practice

### The Tough Question
**Director**: "Are we 100% secure?"
**Bad Answer**: "No, that's impossible." (Sounds incompetent).

**Good Answer**: "We manage risk to an acceptable level. We have invested in detection so that if a breach happens, we catch it fast. We are benchmarked above our peers."
