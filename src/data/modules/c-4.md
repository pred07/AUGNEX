# Attackers vs Assumptions

## 1. What this module covers
Attackers don't follow your network diagram. They follow the path of least resistance. This module challenges the "Assumptions" that Blue teams make (e.g., "The firewall blocks that").

## 2. Why this matters for purple teams
Defensive architectures are built on assumptions. Purple Teaming is the process of physically verifying those assumptions.

## 3. Core concepts explained clearly

### The "Trusted" Network Assumption
*   **Assumption**: "The Internal Network is safe. Only employees are on it."
*   **Reality**: Phishing puts the attacker on the Internal Network immediately.
*   **Attack**: Attacker scans for SMB shares with "Everyone: Full Control".

### The "Egress" Assumption
*   **Assumption**: "We block all outbound ports except 80 and 443."
*   **Reality**: Attacker uses DNS Tunneling (Port 53) or ICMP Tunneling.
*   **Purple Test**: Try to exfiltrate data via DNS.

## 4. Validation examples

### Validating Egress Filtering
1.  **Objective**: Test if we can browse the internet from the Database Server.
2.  **Assumption**: "DB Servers have no internet access."
3.  **Test**: `curl http://www.google.com` from the DB Server.
4.  **Result**: If it returns HTML -> **FAIL**.
5.  **Impact**: If the DB is compromised, the attacker can download C2 tools easily.

## 5. Common gaps and failures
*   **Documentation vs Reality**: The Visio diagram says "Firewall here", but the physical cable bypasses it.
*   **Legacy Exceptions**: "Oh, we opened Port 22 for the backup server 5 years ago and never closed it."

## 6. Key takeaways
*   **Prove it**: If you haven't tested it, it doesn't work.
*   **Drift**: Assumptions degrade over time as configurations change.
