# Attackers vs Assumptions

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module challenges the "Rules of Engagement". What defenders *hope* attackers will do vs what they *actually* do.

### Fit in the Learning Path
"The attacker won't do that, it's too noisy." -> Attacker does it anyway because they know you aren't listening.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Security by Obscurity**.
*   **The "Rules" Fallacy**.
*   **Living off the Land**.

## 2. Core Content

### Common Defender Assumptions
1.  "They will use malware." (Reality: They use your own credentials and RDP).
2.  "They will attack during business hours." (Reality: 3am on Saturday).
3.  "They won't read our documentation." (Reality: They read your LinkedIn to find your tech stack).

### The Reality Check
Attackers follow the path of least resistance.
*   Why write a zero-day exploit (Cost: $1M) when I can Phish the receptionist (Cost: $0)?

## 3. Guided Practice

### Breaking the Assumption
**Assumption**: "Our internal network is safe because the Firewall blocks incoming traffic."

**Attack**:
1.  Phish a user.
2.  Malware makes an *outbound* connection (Reverse Shell).
3.  Firewall allows outbound traffic (Assumption: internal users are trusted).
4.  **Result**: Perimeter bypassed.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Scope**: Do attackers care about "Out of Scope" systems? (No. Real attackers don't have a Rules of Engagement document).
2.  **Tools**: Do attackers use distinct "Hacking Tools"? (Not if they can help it. They use `net.exe`, `whoami`, `powershell`. Tools that are already there).
3.  **Politics**: Attackers don't care about your internal politics or budget cycles.

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You Identify your own biases.
2.  You stop saying "They wouldn't do that."
3.  You understand that **Compliance** is based on Assumptions, while **Security** is based on Reality.
