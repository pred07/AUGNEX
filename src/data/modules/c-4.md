# Attackers vs Assumptions

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module challenges the assumptions defenders make about attackers. Real adversaries don't follow imagined rules—they follow the path of least resistance. Understanding this mismatch is critical for building effective defenses.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Defenders often build security around what they expect attackers to do. Attackers exploit this by doing the unexpected—or by doing the obvious things defenders assume they'll avoid because they're "too noisy."

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will:
*   Identify common defender assumptions
*   Recognize how attackers exploit assumptions
*   Challenge your own mental models about threats
*   Build assumption-aware security strategies

### Mental Model: The Assumption Trap

**How professionals think about this:**
Defenders build defenses against imagined threats. Attackers study actual defenses and find gaps. This mismatch is where most breaches succeed—not through sophisticated exploitation, but through exploiting assumptions.

```
THE ASSUMPTION GAP:

DEFENDER'S MENTAL MODEL:                ATTACKER'S REALITY:

"They'll use malware"                   "I'll use your own tools"
        │                                       │
        ▼                                       ▼
Focus on AV/EDR                         PowerShell, RDP, built-in tools
                                        → Not detected

"They'll attack from outside"           "Already inside via phishing"
        │                                       │
        ▼                                       ▼
Focus on perimeter                      Lateral movement, internal network
                                        → Perimeter is irrelevant

"They're sophisticated"                 "Why be sophisticated?"
        │                                       │
        ▼                                       ▼
Prepare for APT                         Password spray, credential reuse
                                        → Walk in the front door

"Our data isn't valuable"               "Everything has value"
        │                                       │
        ▼                                       ▼
Minimal security investment             Ransomware, crypto mining, botnet
                                        → You're still a target
```

### Common Defender Assumptions

**Assumption 1: Attackers use malware**

```
REALITY CHECK:

Defender assumption:
"Attackers will drop malware → Our AV will catch it"

Attacker reality:
1. Use credentials (purchased, phished, sprayed)
2. Use RDP (legitimate remote access)
3. Use PowerShell (signed Microsoft binary)
4. Use admin tools (PSExec, WMI)

Detection: Zero malware signatures triggered
           Zero sandbox detonations
           Zero file-based IoCs

Result: "Living off the Land" attacks succeed
        because they don't look like "attacks"
```

**Assumption 2: Attackers avoid noise**

```
REALITY CHECK:

Defender assumption:
"Attackers are stealthy → Noisy attacks won't happen"

Attacker reality:
"Are they actually watching?"
"Will anyone respond in time?"
"Speed > Stealth if ransomware is the goal"

Test: Port scan a network at 2am Sunday
      How long until someone responds?
      Often: Never

Result: "Noisy" attacks succeed because
        defenders assume they wouldn't dare
```

**Assumption 3: Critical systems are well-protected**

```
REALITY CHECK:

Defender assumption:
"Important systems get proper security"

Attacker reality:
- Important systems often OLDER (legacy, can't patch)
- Important systems often COMPLEX (hard to secure)
- Important systems often EXCEPTIONS to policy
- "Production can't be disrupted for security"

Result: Crown jewels often LESS protected
        than commodity systems
```

### The Path of Least Resistance

**Attacker economics:**

| Attack Approach | Cost | Likelihood of Success |
|-----------------|------|----------------------|
| Zero-day exploit | $100K-$2M | High if it works |
| Phishing email | $0 | High enough |
| Password spray | $0 | Very high |
| Credential purchase | $10-$1000 | Very high |
| Insider recruitment | Varies | Depends on target |

```
ATTACKER DECISION TREE:

Goal: Access organization's data

Option A: Develop 0-day
├── Cost: Months of work, $$$
├── Risk: Might be patched
└── Likelihood: Last resort

Option B: Phish an employee
├── Cost: Hours of work
├── Risk: Might get caught
└── Likelihood: First attempt

Option C: Buy credentials on dark web
├── Cost: $50
├── Risk: Might be stale
└── Likelihood: Check first

Option D: Password spray
├── Cost: Minutes
├── Risk: Account lockout
└── Likelihood: Always try

ACTUAL ATTACK ORDER: D → C → B → A
```

### Assumption: Internal Network is Safe

**The perimeter fallacy:**

```
DEFENDER ASSUMPTION:

          INTERNET
              │
              │ (This is dangerous)
              ▼
    ┌──────────────────┐
    │    FIREWALL      │ (Lots of investment here)
    └────────┬─────────┘
             │
             ▼
    INTERNAL NETWORK ← (Safe! Trusted!)

ATTACKER REALITY:

    INTERNAL NETWORK
          │
    ┌─────┴─────┐
    │           │
   User A    User B (phished → compromised)
             /    \
            /      \
    File Share    Domain Controller
       │
    Sensitive Data
       │
    Encrypted → Ransomed

The "safe" internal network is where the attack happens
```

### Assumption: We're Not a Target

**Everyone is a target:**

| "We're not a target because..." | Reality |
|---------------------------------|---------|
| "We're too small" | Automated attacks don't care about size |
| "We don't have valuable data" | Compute resources have value (mining, botnet) |
| "We're not in a sensitive industry" | Supply chain attacks use any vendor as pivot |
| "Nobody knows we exist" | Shodan, mass scanning, breach databases |
| "We've never been attacked" | You've never detected an attack |

### Assumption: Compliance Equals Security

**The compliance gap:**

```
COMPLIANCE VIEW:

□ Is there a firewall? Yes
□ Is there antivirus? Yes
□ Are passwords complex? Yes
□ Is there logging? Yes
□ Status: COMPLIANT ✓

SECURITY VIEW:

□ Is the firewall configured correctly? No (default rules)
□ Is antivirus actually running on all systems? No (70%)
□ Are passwords complex AND unique? No (reused)
□ Is anyone reviewing logs? No (never)
□ Status: VULNERABLE ✗

Compliance asks: "Does this exist?"
Security asks: "Does this work?"
```

### Challenge Your Assumptions

**Questions to ask:**

```
ASSUMPTION BUSTING QUESTIONS:

About detection:
- If an attacker used only RDP, would we detect them?
- If an attacker used valid credentials, would we notice?
- If an attacker moved slowly (1 action/day), would we correlate?

About coverage:
- What percentage of systems actually have our agent?
- How do we know that percentage is accurate?
- What systems are explicitly excluded from security controls?

About response:
- If we detected a breach at 3am Saturday, who would respond?
- How long would response actually take?
- Have we ever tested our incident response?

About attackers:
- What attack would we absolutely NOT detect?
- What attack would we detect but not respond to in time?
- What would an attacker who researched us specifically do?
```

### Building Assumption-Aware Security

**Better approach:**

```
ASSUMPTION-AWARE SECURITY:

1. ASSUME BREACH
   └── Design as if attackers are already inside
   └── Internal monitoring as rigorous as perimeter

2. ASSUME EVASION
   └── Attackers know your tools
   └── Layer controls with different detection methods

3. ASSUME FAILURE
   └── Any single control will fail
   └── Defense in depth is mandatory

4. ASSUME IGNORANCE
   └── You don't know what you don't know
   └── Continuous discovery and assessment

5. TEST, DON'T ASSUME
   └── Purple team: Validate detection
   └── Red team: Validate assumptions
   └── Tabletop: Validate response
```

## 3. Guided Practice

### Exercise 1: Assumption Identification

List your organization's (or a hypothetical organization's) security assumptions:

| Assumption | Reality Check |
|------------|---------------|
| 1. ___ | ___ |
| 2. ___ | ___ |
| 3. ___ | ___ |

### Exercise 2: Attack Path Analysis

You need to access the CEO's email. List attack paths ordered by path of least resistance:

1. Easiest: ___
2. Easier: ___
3. Moderate: ___
4. Hardest: ___

Which would most defenders focus on defending against?

### Exercise 3: Assumption Busting Scenarios

For each defender statement, describe the attacker's counter:

| Defender Says | Attacker Does |
|---------------|---------------|
| "Our perimeter is locked down" | ___ |
| "We'd detect malware immediately" | ___ |
| "No one would try brute force, it's too noisy" | ___ |
| "Our employees are trained on phishing" | ___ |

## 4. Reflection Check

### Understanding Assumptions
1. "Real attackers would never do that—it's too risky." What's wrong with this thinking?

2. Your organization passed a security audit. What assumptions might you be making about your security posture?

3. Why do sophisticated nation-state attackers often use simple techniques like phishing?

### Practical Thinking
1. How would you test whether your assumptions about detection capability are valid?

2. An executive says "We're not a target." How do you respond?

3. Your security is designed around "sophisticated attackers." What might you be missing?

---

## 5. Key Misconceptions

**MYTH: "Attackers follow rules of engagement"**
REALITY: Only authorized testers have ROE. Real attackers have no limitations.

**MYTH: "Noisy attacks won't work on us"**
REALITY: You need to prove this through testing, not assume it.

**MYTH: "Sophisticated attackers use sophisticated techniques"**
REALITY: Sophisticated attackers use whatever works. Simple techniques often work.

**MYTH: "We'd know if we were compromised"**
REALITY: Average dwell time is months. You likely wouldn't know.

**MYTH: "Our security team thinks like attackers"**
REALITY: Defenders face constraints (budget, politics, operations) that shape their thinking differently from attackers.
