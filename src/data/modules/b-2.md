# Secure Software Development Life Cycle (S-SDLC)

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module transforms the abstract idea of "shifting left" into concrete engineering practices. You will learn how to integrate security controls at every stage of the SDLC—not as gates that slow developers down, but as guardrails that allow them to move fast safely.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will:
*   Map security activities to standard Agile/DevOps phases
*   Design a "paved road" (Golden Path) for developers
*   Differentiate between SAST, DAST, SCA, and IAST
*   Implement a "Security Champion" program model

## 2. Core Content

### The V-Model vs. Agile S-SDLC
Traditional security was a "gate" before release. In Agile/DevOps, security must be continuous.

**The Pipeline:**
1.  **Design:** Threat Modeling, Security Requirements (ASVS).
2.  **Code:** IDE Linters, Pre-commit hooks (Secret scanning).
3.  **Build:** SAST (Static Analysis), SCA (dependency check).
4.  **Test:** DAST (Dynamic Analysis), Automated pentests.
5.  **Deploy:** IaC Scanning, Configuration checks.
6.  **Operate:** RASP, WAF, Monitoring.

### Deep Dive: Dependency Management (SCA)
Modern apps are 80% open source libraries.
*   **Risk:** You write secure code, but import `log4j`.
*   **Solution:** Software Composition Analysis (SCA).
*   **Engineering Rule:** Break the build if a *Critical* or *High* vulnerability is introduced in a dependency.
*   **Tools:** OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, GitHub Dependabot.

### The "Golden Path" Strategy
Don't just inspect; assist.
*   Instead of asking "Did you use encryption?", provide a verified `EncryptionService` library.
*   Instead of asking "Is your container secure?", provide a hardened Base Image.
*   *Netflix Principle:* "The paved road is easiest to travel."

## 3. Guided Lab: CI/CD Security Injection

### Scenario
You have a GitHub Actions workflow building a Node.js app.

### Task 1: Add Secret Scanning
*   **Tool:** Gitleaks or TruffleHog.
*   **Why:** Prevent API keys from being committed.
*   **Placement:** Pre-commit hook (local) AND Build step (server).

### Task 2: Add SAST
*   **Tool:** Semgrep (lightweight, fast).
*   **Config:** Scan for OWASP Top 10 patterns (e.g., `eval()`, direct SQL concatenation).
*   **Policy:** Fail build on "High Severity".

### Task 3: Add DAST
*   **Tool:** OWASP ZAP (Baseline Scan).
*   **Placement:** After deployment to Staging environment.

## 4. Reflection Check

### Knowledge Check
1.  Why is SCA considered "low hanging fruit" with high ROI?
2.  What is the downside of running DAST on every commit? (Hint: Speed).
3.  How does a "Golden Path" reduce false positives?

---

## 5. Completion Criteria
1.  **Define** the 3 primary types of automated security scanning (SAST, DAST, SCA).
2.  **Audit** a sample CI/CD pipeline and identify missing security steps.
