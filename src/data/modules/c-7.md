# Understanding Kill Chains End-to-End

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module replays the "Movie" of a breach. From the first email to the data theft.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Individual alerts allow you to miss the big picture. Seeing the *sequence* is how you stop the breach.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **The Narrative**.
*   **Pivot Points**.
*   **Choke Points**.

## 2. Core Content

### The Narrative Arc
1.  **Entry**: Phishing -> User Clicks.
2.  **Establishment**: C2 Beacon start.
3.  **Privilege Escalation**: User -> Admin.
4.  **Lateral Movement**: Laptop -> Server.
5.  **Action**: Database Dump.

### Choke Points
Places where the attacker *must* pass through.
*   **The Gateway**: All C2 must leave the network.
*   **The Admin Account**: To own the network, they usually need Domain Admin.
*   **Defensive Strategy**: Focus heavily on monitoring Choke Points.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Reconstructing a Breach
**Logs**:
1.  09:00: `outlook.exe` spawns `powershell.exe`. (Entry).
2.  09:05: `powershell.exe` downloads `unknown_file`. (Tooling).
3.  09:10: `unknown_file` runs `net group "Domain Admins"`. (Recon).
4.  09:30: RDP from Laptop to DC01. (Lateral Move).

**Analysis**:
Where could we have stopped this?
*   Step 1: Macro execution policy.
*   Step 2: Web Filter blocking uncategorized sites.
*   Step 4: MFA on RDP.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Dwell Time**: If you catch them at Step 4, is it a win? (Yes. No data stolen yet).
2.  **Noise**: Step 3 (Recon) is often noisy. Did the SIEM ignore it?
3.  **Graph**: The attack is a path through the graph. Cut the edges.

---

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can narrate an attack story.
2.  You identify **Choke Points** in your network.
3.  You understand that breaking the chain at *any* point stops the breach.
