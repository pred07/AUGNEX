# Understanding Kill Chains End-to-End

## 1. What this module covers
Looking at the *entire* attack path, not just individual events. Real attacks are a sequence of steps (The Kill Chain).

## 2. Why this matters for purple teams
Blocking the attacker at *any* stage breaks the chain. You don't need to be perfect 100% of the time; you just need to win once before the "Actions on Objectives" phase.

## 3. Core concepts explained clearly

### Functional Kill Chain
1.  **Recon** (Scanner).
2.  **Delivery** (Email).
3.  **Exploitation** (Code Run).
4.  **Action** (Ransomware).

### Opportunity Costs
*   Blocking **Recon** is hard (public internet).
*   Blocking **Delivery** is feasible (Email Filter).
*   Blocking **Exploitation** is critical (Patching).
*   Blocking **Action** is the last resort (Backup recovery).

## 4. Validation examples

### Emulating a Full Chain
1.  **Step 1**: Send a benign phishing email. -> Did it land?
2.  **Step 2**: User clicks link to benign C2. -> Did Proxy block it?
3.  **Step 3**: Payload runs `whoami`. -> Did EDR alert?
4.  **Step 4**: Exfiltrate `dummy.txt`. -> Did DLP alert?

### Scorecard
*   Detected at Step 1? No.
*   Detected at Step 2? No.
*   Detected at Step 3? Yes! (Success).

## 5. Common gaps and failures
*   **Missing lateral movement**: Organizations often spot the initial entry but fail to see the attacker moving server-to-server internally. The "Internal Soft Underbelly".

## 6. Key takeaways
*   **Choke Points**: Identify where the attacker *must* pass (e.g., Domain Admin login) and heavily monitor that choke point.
