# Threat Intelligence Integration

## 1. What this module covers
Connecting external "Intel" (IOCs, TTP profiles) into your internal detection. "Knowing the Enemy".

## 2. Why this matters for purple teams
Simulate *real* actors. "Let's simulate APT29 today", not just random attacks.

## 3. Core concepts explained clearly

### Types of Intel
*   **Tactical**: IOCs (IPs, Hashes). Good for blocking.
*   **Operational**: TTPs (Techniques). Good for hunting.
*   **Strategic**: Who and Why. (Finance sector targeting).

### The Pyramid of Pain (Again)
*   Intel feeds give you millons of IPs (Painful to manage).
*   Intel reports give you TTPs (Valuable).

## 4. Validation examples

### TTP Emulation
1.  **Intel Report**: "APT33 uses `Nanocore` RAT delivered via Spearphishing with `Excel` macros."
2.  **Purple Plan**:
    *   Create a benign Excel Macro.
    *   Configure C2 to mimic Nanocore traffic patterns.
3.  **Execution**: Launch the campaign against test users.
4.  **Metric**: Did we detect the specific TTPs of APT33?

## 5. Common gaps and failures
*   **Stale Intel**: Blocking an IP that was bad 2 years ago but is now a legitimate Google server.
*   **Context**: "Alert on IP X". Why? Analyst needs to know "IP X is associated with Ransomware Group Y".

## 6. Key takeaways
*   **Relevance**: Ignore intel about threats that don't target your sector.
*   **Automate**: Ingest IOCs automatically. Humans should analyze TTPs.
