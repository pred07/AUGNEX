# Threat Intelligence Integration

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers operationalizing **Threat Intel**. Making it actionable.

### Fit in the Learning Path
A feed of IPs is useless if it doesn't block anything.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **TIP** (Threat Intel Platform).
*   **Automated Blocking**.
*   **Confidence Scores**.

---

## 2. Core Content

### The Pipeline
Intel Feed -> TIP -> Firewall/SIEM.
*   *Risk*: Blocking a Google IP because a feed said it was bad.
*   *Mitigation*: Confidence Scoring. Only block if Confidence > 90.

### Aging
Indicators expire.
*   Attacker used `1.2.3.4` yesterday. Today it's a library.
*   *Action*: Remove IOCs after 30 days automatically.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Testing the Feed
**Action**: Add a "Safe" IP (e.g., your home IP) to the Blocklist Feed *with high confidence*.
**Verify**:
1.  Does the Firewall block you? (It should).
2.  Does the SIEM alert on current connections?

**Note**: Do this carefully! Don't block the CEO.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Context**: "Why is this IP bad?" (If the feed doesn't say, it's low value).
2.  **Feedback**: If you find an FP, how do you tell the Feed Provider?
3.  **Open Source**: MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform). The standard for sharing.

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You automate **IOC Ingestion**.
2.  You automate **IOC Expiration**.
3.  You validate that the **Blocklist** actually blocks.
