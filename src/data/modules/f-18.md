# Pipes, Redirection, and Environment Variables

## Introduction

The real power of Linux is "chaining" commands together. You can take the output of one tool and feed it into another.

## 1. The Pipe (`|`)

The pipe takes the output of the Left command and gives it to the Right command.

*   `cat huge_file.txt | less`
    *   (Read file) -> (Feed into pager to read slowly).
*   `ps aux | grep firefox`
    *   (List all processes) -> (Search for "firefox").

## 2. Redirection (`>`)

This saves output to a file.

*   `>` (Overwrite): `echo "Hello" > file.txt` (Deletes old content).
*   `>>` (Append): `echo "New line" >> file.txt` (Adds to the end).

## 3. Environment Variables

These are global variables that allow your shell to work.

*   **`$PATH`**: A list of folders where Linux looks for commands. Use `echo $PATH` to see it.
*   **`$USER`**: Who you are.
*   **`$HOME`**: Where you live.

## Why This Matters

*   **Pipes**: Essential for log analysis. "Show me all logins (`cat logs`) -> Filter for 'Failed' (`grep`) -> Count them (`wc`)."
*   **Environment Variables**: Attackers often look for "API Keys" or "Passwords" accidentally stored in environment variables.
