# DNS and Name Resolution

## Introduction

Computers talk in numbers (IPs), but humans talk in names (google.com). **DNS (Domain Name System)** is the phonebook of the internet.

## How it Works

1.  You type `google.com`.
2.  Your computer asks its **DNS Resolver** (usually 8.8.8.8 or your ISP): "Who is google.com?"
3.  The Resolver looks up the hierarchy:
    *   **Root (.)**: "I don't know, but `.com` is handled by Verisign."
    *   **TLD (.com)**: "I don't know, but `google.com` is handled by `ns1.google.com`."
    *   **Authoritative (`ns1.google.com`)**: "Yes, `google.com` is `142.250.72.14`."
4.  Resolver gives the IP to your computer.
5.  Your computer connects to the IP.

## Record Types

*   **A**: Maps Name -> IPv4.
*   **AAAA**: Maps Name -> IPv6.
*   **CNAME**: Maps Name -> Another Name (Alias).
*   **MX**: Mail Exchange (Who handles email?).
*   **TXT**: Text notes. (Often used for verification).

## The Hosts File

Before checking DNS, your computer checks a local file:
*   Windows: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`
*   Linux: `/etc/hosts`

Hackers edit this file to trick the computer (e.g., making `facebook.com` go to `127.0.0.1`).

## Why This Matters

*   **Recon**: Finding all subdomains (`dev.target.com`, `admin.target.com`) is key to finding a weak spot.
*   **Attacks**: "DNS Poisoning" or "Man-in-the-Middle" attacks often target this resolution process.
