# Penetration Testing vs Red Teaming vs VA

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module nuances the specific types of security assessments: **Vulnerability Assessment (VA)**, **Penetration Testing**, and **Red Teaming**.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Clients often confuse these terms. They ask for a "Red Team" when they really need a "Vulnerability Scan". You must know the difference to sell and deliver the right service.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   The **Breadth vs Depth** trade-off.
*   That VA is automated; Pentesting is manual.
*   The cost/time difference between the three.

## 2. Core Content

### 1. Vulnerability Assessment (VA)
*   **Method**: Automated Scanners (Nessus, Qualys).
*   **Output**: A 500-page list of potential bugs. High false positives.
*   **Value**: Quick compliance check. "Do we have outdated Windows servers?"

### 2. Penetration Test
*   **Method**: Manual verification of VA results + Business Logic / Chained attacks.
*   **Output**: valid, exploited proof of vulnerability.
*   **Value**: "Can a hacker actually break in?"

### 3. Red Team Operation
*   **Method**: Adversary Emulation (TTPs). Social Engineering, Physical access, Malware.
*   **Output**: Analysis of the *Defense's* performance.
*   **Value**: "Is our Blue Team awake?"

## 3. Guided Practice

### The Assessment Matrix
Classify the following tools/actions.

**Action 1**: Running `Nessus` against a subnet.
*   **Type**: Vulnerability Assessment.

**Action 2**: Manually crafting a SQL Injection payload to bypass a WAF.
*   **Type**: Penetration Test.

**Action 3**: Sending a phishing email to HR to get initial access.
*   **Type**: Red Team.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **ROI**: Why shouldn't a small startup pay for a Red Team? (Because they have no Blue Team to test. They need a Basic Pentest first).
2.  **Automation**: Can an automated tool ever replace a human Pentester? (No. Tools cannot understand business logic or context).
3.  **Noise**: Which of these three is the "loudest" on the network? (VA. It sprays packets everywhere).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can visualize the Triangle: VA (Broad/Shallow), Pentest (Focused/Deep), Red Team (Targeted/Stealth).
2.  You understand that a VA is a *prerequisite* for a Pentest.
