# Penetration Testing vs Red Teaming vs Vulnerability Assessment

## 1. Unit Brief: Distinguishing the Disciplines
These three terms are often used interchangeably by HR departments and marketing, but technically, they are vastly different services. Knowing the difference allows you to sell the right service to a client and execute the correct methodology.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Client**: "We want you to hack us to see if we are secure."
*   **You**: "Do you want a list of all outdated software (VA), a deep dive into your application's logic flaws (Pentest), or a simulation of a Russian ransomware gang (Red Team)?"

If you sell a Red Team engagement to a client who needs a Vulnerability Assessment, you will fail.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Vulnerability Assessment (VA)
*   **Depth**: 1 inch deep, 1 mile wide.
*   **Focus**: Quantity. Finding known vulnerabilities (CVEs), missing patches, misconfigurations.
*   **Tools**: Automated Scanners (Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys).
*   **Human Effort**: Low to Medium (Verification of false positives).
*   **Analogy**: Checking if all the doors and windows are locked.

### Penetration Testing (Pentest)
*   **Depth**: 1 mile deep (in specific areas), 1 mile wide.
*   **Focus**: Exploitation. Chaining vulnerabilities to prove impact. Finding logic flaws scanners miss.
*   **Tools**: Burp Suite, Metasploit, Custom Scripts + Manual Brainpower.
*   **Human Effort**: High.
*   **Analogy**: Picking the lock, entering the house, and seeing if you can open the safe.

### Red Teaming (Adversary Simulation)
*   **Depth**: Unrestricted (Goal-oriented).
*   **Focus**: Objective. "Steal the Crown Jewels" or "Deploy Ransomware" without being stopped. Social Engineering and Physical Security often included.
*   **Tools**: Custom C2 (Command & Control), Evasion frameworks.
*   **Human Effort**: Very High. Team-based.
*   **Analogy**: Breaking into the house while the guards are patrolling, stealing the safe, and leaving without anyone noticing until the next morning.

## 4. Practical Examples

### The Scan Result (VA)
A VA scanner reports:
> **Critical**: Apache Struts 2.3.x vulnerable to RCE (CVE-2017-5638).

*   **VA Action**: Report it.
*   **Pentest Action**: Attempt to exploit it to get a shell. If successful, use that shell to pivot to the database.

### The Logic Flaw (Pentest)
A scanner sees a "Transfer Money" form. It checks for SQLi and XSS. It finds nothing.
A **Pentester** notices that changing `from_account=123` to `from_account=456` allows stealing money from another user.
*   **Result**: This is an IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference). Scanners rarely find this.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Thinking "Running Nessus" is Penetration Testing**: That is a text-book Vulnerability Assessment.
*   **Over-relying on Automation**: Scanners are dumb. They don't understand business context.
*   **Ignoring the Goal**: In a Red Team op, if you find a SQLi that triggers an alert, you might choose *not* to use it to preserve stealth.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **VA** = "What is potentially wrong?" (Breadth).
*   **Pentest** = "Can it actually be exploited?" (Depth + Impact).
*   **Red Team** = "Can you stop us?" (Response + Process).
