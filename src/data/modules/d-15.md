# Network Defense Fundamentals

## 1. Unit Brief: The Castle Walls
Network defense is about defining the perimeter and controlling traffic. If you control the network, you control the battlefield.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Flat Network**: Hacker breaches Reception PC -> Lateral Moves to Database -> Game Over.
*   **Segmented Network**: Hacker breaches Reception PC -> Blocked by Firewall when trying to reach Database -> Game On.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Defense in Depth
Layers of defense.
1.  **Edge**: Firewall (Block bad IPs).
2.  **Internal**: Switch ACLs (VLANs).
3.  **Host**: Software Firewall (Block inbound ports).

### The "Zero Trust" Model
"Never Trust, Always Verify."
*   Old Way: "If you are in the office, you are trusted."
*   New Way: "I don't care if you are in the CEO's office. You still need MFA to access the file share."

## 4. Practical Examples

### Access Control Lists (ACLs)
Router logic:
`permit tcp 192.168.1.10 host 10.0.0.5 eq 3306` (Allow Web to DB).
`deny ip any any` (Block everything else).

### Network Address Translation (NAT)
Hides internal IPs (`192.168.x.x`) from the internet.
*   **Security Benefit**: Hackers cannot directly route packets to your laptop. They must hit the Gateway first.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Default Allow**: "I'll open all ports to make it work, then lock it down later." (You will never lock it down later).
*   **Documentation**: Unlabeled cables and unlabeled VLANs. "What does Port 44 do?" -> "I don't know, don't touch it." -> It was the backdoor.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Deny All**: The only safe default.
*   **Segmentation**: Break the network into small, isolated islands.
