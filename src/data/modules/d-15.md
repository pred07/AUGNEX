# Network Defense Fundamentals

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module kicks off the "Network Defense" section. We transition from "Reading Logs" to "Building Walls".

### Fit in the Learning Path
You've learned how to see (Logs). Now you learn how to stop (Defense).

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Defense in Depth** (The Castle Model).
*   **Least Privilege** applied to Networks.
*   **Zero Trust** basics.

## 2. Core Content

### The Perimeter is Dead
Old Model: Hard shell (Firewall), soft center.
New Model: **Zero Trust**.
*   Assume the network is *already* compromised.
*   Verify every request, even if it comes from inside the building.

### Defense in Depth
Layers of security:
1.  **Edge**: Firewall / DDoS protection.
2.  **network**: Segmentation (VLANs).
3.  **Endpoint**: EDR / Antivirus.
4.  **Application**: WAF / Input Validation.
5.  **Data**: Encryption.

*   *Effect*: If one layer fails, the next catches it.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Designing a Defense
**Asset**: A Database Server.

**Layer 1 (Network)**: Put it in a private subnet. Only allow port 3306 from the Web Server.
**Layer 2 (Host)**: Enable OS Firewall (iptables).
**Layer 3 (Auth)**: Strong complex passwords.
**Layer 4 (Data)**: Encrypt the disk.

**Scenario**: Attacker steals the hard drive physically.
**Result**: Drive is encrypted. Data safe. (Layer 4 saved us).

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Trust**: Why shouldn't we trust the Office Wi-Fi? (Because a visitor could plug in a compromised device. Treat the office LAN like a Starbucks Wi-Fi).
2.  **Complexity**: Does more layers mean more security? (Yes, but also more complexity. Complexity is the enemy of security. Find the balance).
3.  **Human**: Where does the "User" fit in? (The Human Layer. Phishing training is Defense in Depth too).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can diagram the "Castle" vs "Zero Trust" model.
2.  You understand that a Firewall is not enough.
3.  You apply "Least Privilege" to network ports (Close everything by default).
