# Introduction to Cybersecurity and Computing

## Introduction

Before we hack, we must understand. Cybersecurity is not magic; it’s the applied understanding of how systems work, how they fail, and how to protect them. This module sets the mental model for your entire journey.

## What is a Computer System?

At its core, a computer system is a machine that processes data. It consists of three primary layers where we operate:

1.  **Hardware**: The physical chips (CPU, Memory, Storage).
2.  **Kernel**: The core software that talks to hardware.
3.  **User Space**: Where your applications (browser, shell, tools) run.

> **Key Concept**: Vulnerabilities can exist in any of these layers. A secure app running on a compromised kernel is not secure.

## Where Attacks Happen

Attacks typically target three domains:

### 1. Operating Systems (OS)
The foundation. If an attacker controls the OS (Windows/Linux), they own the machine.
*   **Target**: Gaining complete control ("Root" or "System" access).

### 2. Networks
The communication lines. Systems talk to each other.
*   **Target**: Intercepting data, impersonating machines, or mapping infrastructure.

### 3. Web Applications
The interface. This is what you see in the browser.
*   **Target**: Stealing user data, tricking the database, or hijacking sessions.

## The Triad: CIA

Everything we do in security maps to protecting one of these three:

*   **Confidentiality**: Keeping secrets secret. (e.g., Encryption)
*   **Integrity**: Preventing unauthorized changes. (e.g., File hashing)
*   **Availability**: Keeping the system running. (e.g., DDoS protection)

## Why This Matters

You cannot secure (or break) what you do not understand. If you don't know how a web request works, you cannot understand SQL Injection. If you don't know how Linux permissions work, you cannot escalate privileges.

## Next Steps

We will build your lab next. You will stop reading about hacking and start building the environment where you will practice it safely.
