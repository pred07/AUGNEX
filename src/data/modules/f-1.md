# Introduction to Cybersecurity and Computing Systems

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module establishes the foundational mental model required for cybersecurity. It moves beyond "using" a computer to "understanding" how it functions at an architectural level. We break down the relationship between Hardware, the Kernel, and User Space.

### Fit in the Learning Path
This is the very first step of the **FORGE** path. Before you can secure (Protector) or break (Exploit) a system, you must understand the rules that govern it.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   The three layers of a computing system (Hardware, Kernel, User Space).
*   The concept of Privilege Rings (Ring 0 vs Ring 3).
*   The fundamental goals of security (CIA Triad) in a technical context.

## 2. Core Content

### The Machine Components
Cybersecurity is not magic; it is the manipulation of physics and logic. A computer system consists of three distinct layers:

1.  **Hardware (The Physical)**: The CPU, RAM, and Disk details. The hardware executes instructions but does not decide *which* instructions to execute. It blindly follows the CPU Pointer.
2.  **The Kernel (The Governor)**: The core of the Operating System (OS). The Kernel interacts directly with hardware. It manages memory, processes, and permissions. It runs in **Ring 0** (Highest Privilege).
3.  **User Space (The Inhabitants)**: Where your browser, games, and tools live. Applications in User Space cannot touch hardware directly; they must ask the Kernel nicely using **System Calls**. This runs in **Ring 3** (Restricted Privilege).

### The Security Boundary
The most critical security boundary in any computer is the line between **User Space** and **Kernel Space**.
*   **Exploit Goal**: Attackers often try to "escape" User Space to gain Kernel privileges (Privilege Escalation).
*   **Defense Goal**: Defenders try to keep users and applications contained within their assigned permissions.

### The CIA Triad (Technical View)
Every security action maps to these three pillars:
*   **Confidentiality**: Ensuring data is read only by authorized processes (e.g., File Permissions, Encryption).
*   **Integrity**: Ensuring data is not altered by unauthorized processes (e.g., Hashing, Digital Signatures).
*   **Availability**: Ensuring the system can process data when requested (e.g., Load Balancers, DDoS prevention).

## 3. Guided Practice

### Inspecting Your System Scope
We will use your local command line to inspect the high-level identity of your system. This validates where you are "sitting" in the digital world.

**Step 1: Open a Terminal**
*   **Windows**: Press `Win + X` and select **Terminal** or **PowerShell**.
*   **Linux/Mac**: Open your terminal application.

**Step 2: Query System Info**
Run the following command to see your Kernel/OS details:

*   **Windows**:
    ```powershell
    systeminfo | Select-String "OS Name","OS Version","System Type"
    ```
*   **Linux**:
    ```bash
    uname -a
    ```

**Step 3: Identity**
Check who you are running as:
```bash
whoami
```

**Observation**:
*   The output of `whoami` tells you your **User Space** identity.
*   Even if it says `Administrator` (Windows) or `root` (Linux), you are still interacting with the system through a Shell application. You are not *becoming* the hardware.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Attacker Perspective**: If you find a bug in a User Space application (like Chrome), why is it less valuable than finding a bug in the Kernel?
2.  **Defender Perspective**: Why do modern operating systems prevent User Space programs from writing directly to RAM?
3.  **Critical Thinking**: Can software ever physically damage hardware? (Research "Stuxnet" or "Killer Poke" for historical context).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You have run the `systeminfo` or `uname` commands on your own machine.
2.  You can explain the difference between **User Space** and **Kernel Space** in one sentence.
3.  You acknowledge that "Administrator" does not mean "Unlimited Power" (The Kernel still rules).
