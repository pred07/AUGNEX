# The Intelligence Lifecycle

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
The Intelligence Lifecycle (F3EAD or Traditional Cycle) is the operating system of a CTI team. It prevents "Intelligence Failure"—the state where you collect everything but understand nothing. We focus heavily on **Direction (Planning)** and **Feedback**, the two most neglected steps.

### Fit in the Learning Path
You have the Mindset (S-1). Now you need the Process. Without this lifecycle, you are just a "News Aggregator," not an Intelligence Analyst.

### Learning Objectives
*   Master the 6 phases: **Direction, Collection, Processing, Analysis, Dissemination, Feedback**.
*   Define **PIRs (Priority Intelligence Requirements)** to stop aimless data hoarding.
*   Understand why the "Feedback Loop" is critical for survival.

## 2. Core Content

### Phase 1: Direction (Requirements)
The most critical phase. If you don't know what you are looking for, you will find noise.
*   **PIRs (Priority Intelligence Requirements):** The specific questions leadership needs answered.
    *   *Bad PIR:* "Tell me about hackers."
    *   *Good PIR:* "Which ransomware groups are actively targeting Tier-1 Automotive suppliers in Europe?"
*   **The Stakeholder Interview:** You must interview your CISO/SOC Lead to build these.

### Phase 2: Collection
Gathering raw data to answer the PIRs.
*   **Sources:** OSINT (Open Source), CSINT (Closed/Dark Web), TECHINT (Telemetry/Logs), HUMINT (Human networking).
*   **Challenge:** "Collection Bias" (Collecting what is easy, not what is needed).

### Phase 3: Processing
Turning raw data into a usable format.
*   **Tasks:** Translating foreign language reports, decrypting files, normalizing JSON/CSV/XML formats, enriching IP addresses with Geo-location.
*   **Tooling:** SIEM ingestion, SOAR playbooks.

### Phase 4: Analysis
The "Brain" work. Converting Information into Intelligence.
*   **Action:** Correlating Module A with Event B. Assessing validity. Assigning confidence levels.
*   **Mechanism:** Structured Analytic Techniques (SATs) like ACH (Analysis of Competing Hypotheses).

### Phase 5: Dissemination
Delivering the product to the RIGHT person in the RIGHT format.
*   **Tactical:** JSON feed to the Firewall (Machine-readable).
*   **Operational:** PDF report to the Incident Response Lead.
*   **Strategic:** 1-page Briefing Slide to the Board of Directors.

### Phase 6: Feedback
Did it work?
*   "Did this report help you mitigate the threat?"
*   "Was the feed too noisy?"
*   *If you skip this, you are shouting into the void.*

## 3. Lab: Architecture of a Requirement

### Scenario
Your CISO asks: "Are we safe from that new vulnerability?"

### Task 1: Refine the Requirement (Direction)
*   **Vague:** "Are we safe?"
*   **Refined PIR:** "Does our asset inventory contain software versions vulnerable to CVE-2024-XXXX, and is active exploitation observed in our sector?"

### Task 2: Collection Plan
*   **Internal:** Query CMDB/EDR for software versions.
*   **External:** Check CISA KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities) list and vendor blogs.

### Task 3: Analysis
*   *Fact:* We have 5 servers with the software.
*   *Fact:* Exploitation is massive in the Wild.
*   *Assessment:* High Risk. Immediate patching required.

## 4. Operational Reality Check
*   **The backlog:** Intelligence teams often get stuck in "Collection" and never do "Analysis."
*   **The solution:** Automated processing pipelines.

## 5. Completion Criteria
1.  **Draft** a PIR for a Financial Service client.
2.  **Explain** why "Dissemination" requires different formats for different people.
3.  **Identify** where the cycle usually breaks (Feedback).
