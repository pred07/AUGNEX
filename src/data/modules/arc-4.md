# Risk Management Fundamentals

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers **SLE**, **ALE**, and the **Risk Register**.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Mathematics of fear.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Asset Value (AV)**.
*   **Exposure Factor (EF)**.
*   **Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)**.

---

## 2. Core Content

### The Equation
`Risk = Threat x Vulnerability x Impact`.

### Quantitative Risk
Putting a dollar sign on it.
*   **SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)**: Asset Value ($100k) x Exposure Factor (50%) = $50k.
*   **ARO (Annual Rate of Occurrence)**: Happens once every 10 years (0.1).
*   **ALE (Annualized Loss Expectancy)**: SLE ($50k) x ARO (0.1) = $5,000.

*Decision*: If the firewall costs $10,000/year to stop this risk, **don't buy it**. You lose money by being secure.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Building the Risk Register
A spreadsheet of doom.
*   **Columns**: Risk ID, Description, Likelihood (1-5), Impact (1-5), Risk Score (L x I), Owner, Treatment.
*   **Treatment Options**:
    1.  **Mitigate**: Fix it (Patch).
    2.  **Transfer**: Insurance.
    3.  **Accept**: Sign the waiver.
    4.  **Avoid**: Turn off the server.

**Task**: Add "Ransomware" to the register.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Subjectivity**: "High Likelihood" means different things to different people. Define it (e.g., > 50% chance this year).
2.  **Paper Trail**: If you accept a risk, get the CEO to sign it. When the breach happens, that signature saves your job.
3.  **Dynamic**: Risk changes daily. The register is a living document.

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can calculate **ALE**.
2.  You maintain a **Risk Register**.
3.  You understand the **4 Risk Treatments**.
