# Dark Web Intelligence Operations

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
The "Dark Web" (Tor/I2P) is where threats are bought and sold. This module covers accessing these networks safely, monitoring marketplaces, and tracking ransomware leak sites.

### Learning Objectives
*   Understand **Onion Routing** principles.
*   Access Tor safely (OPSEC).
*   Monitor **Ransomware Leak Sites**.

## 2. Core Content

### Tor Architecture
*   **Entry Guard:** Knows your IP. Doesn't know where you are going.
*   **Middle Relay:** Knows nothing. Just passes encrypted data.
*   **Exit Node:** Knows where you are going. Doesn't know who you are.
*   **Hidden Services (.onion):** Traffic never leaves the Tor network. End-to-end encryption and anonymity for the server.

### Monitoring Locations
1.  **Marketplaces:** Drugs, stolen credit cards, malware source code.
2.  **Forums:** XSS, Exploit.in, BreachForums. (Where actors recruit and sell access: Initial Access Brokers).
3.  **Leak Sites:** LockBit, Alphv. (Where victims are shamed and data is published).

### OPSEC (Revisited)
NEVER access the Dark Web from a corporate asset directly. Use a specialized dirty line or a cloud-based isolation browser (Silo).

## 3. Lab: Leak Site Tracking

### Scenario
Check a Ransomware leak site (Simulation/Archives).

1.  **Find the Onion URL:** (Usually tracked on trackers like ransomwatch).
2.  **Search:** Look for your company ecosystem (Suppliers, Partners, Competitors).
3.  **Finding:** Your payroll provider is listed as "Publishing in 24 hours".
4.  **Action:** Trigger Incident Response Plan. Assume Third-Party Compromise.

## 4. Reflection
1.  Is it illegal to access the Dark Web? (In most countries, no. Buying drugs/malware is illegal. Looking is intelligence).
2.  Why do we not buy our own stolen data back? (It funds the criminals, encourages repeat attacks, and there is no guarantee they delete it).
