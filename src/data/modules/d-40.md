# Patch and Vulnerability Management

## 1. Unit Brief: The Rat Race
Software has bugs. Vendors release Patches. Attackers reverse-engineer patches to write Exploits. You must patch before the attacker exploits. It is a race.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Equifax Breach**: Apache Struts vulnerability. Patch was available for 2 months. They didn't apply it. 147 million identities lost.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Scanning
Using tools (Nessus, Qualys) to find missing patches.
*   **Authenticated Scan**: Scanner logs in and checks DLL versions. (Accurate).
*   **Unauthenticated Scan**: Scanner looks at banner versions from outside. (Less accurate).

### Prioritization
You have 10,000 missing patches. You can't fix all.
*   **Prioritize**:
    1.  Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    2.  Public Exploit Available.
    3.  Critical Asset (Database).

### Testing
*   Apply patch in Dev. Does it crash the app?
*   Apply in Prod.

## 4. Practical Examples

### The "Patch Tuesday" Cycle
*   Microsoft releases patches on 2nd Tuesday.
*   Attackers analyze them on Wednesday.
*   Exploits appear on Friday.
*   **Goal**: Patch Criticals within 48 hours.

### Virtual Patching (WAF)
*   You can't upgrade the legacy web app code.
*   **Solution**: Tell the WAF (Web Application Firewall) to block the specific attack signature associated with the vulnerability. The app is still broken, but the shield stops the arrow.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Focusing on Servers only**: Laptops (Adobe Reader, Chrome) and Network Gear (VPN Gateway) need patching too.
*   **Excel Hell**: Managing vulnerabilities in spreadsheets. Use a platform.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Mean Time To Patch (MTTP)**: The metric of success.
*   **Legacy**: If you can't patch it, isolate it.
