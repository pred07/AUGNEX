# Governance Coverage, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers the "Boring but Critical" stuff. **Policies**, **Audits**, and **Risk Registers**.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Technical tools fail. Governance ensures processes exist to fix them.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Risk**: Acceptance, mitigation, Transfer, Avoidance.
*   **Compliance**: GDPR, SOC2, ISO 27001.
*   **Policy** vs **Standard** vs **Procedure**.

## 2. Core Content

### Risk Management
You cannot fix everything.
*   **Mitigate**: Install a firewall.
*   **Transfer**: Buy insurance.
*   **Accept**: "It costs $1M to fix this $10k risk. We accept the risk."
*   **Avoid**: Shut down the service.

### The Documents
1.  **Policy**: High level. "We must encrypt passwords." (Mandatory).
2.  **Standard**: Specific. "Use AES-256."
3.  **Procedure**: Step-by-step. "How to enable AES-256."
4.  **Guideline**: "Best practices." (Optional).

## 3. Guided Practice

### The Audit
**Auditor asks**: "Do you offboard employees immediately?"
**You say**: "Yes."
**Auditor**: "Show me the evidence."
*   You must provide ticket logs showing HR request and IT execution timestamps match.
**Result**: If not, you fail SOC2. You lose customers.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Checkbox security**: Is Compliance = Security? (No. You can be compliant and still get hacked. But Compliance raises the baseline).
2.  **Executive**: GRC is how you talk to the Board. (They don't care about SQL Injection. They care about "Legal Liability").
3.  **Culture**: Policy is useless if culture ignores it.

---

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can define the 4 Risk Treatments.
2.  You understand that **Evidence** is everything in an audit.
3.  You respect the **Risk Register** as the steering wheel of the security program.
