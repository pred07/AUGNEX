# Deception Operations for Intelligence

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
Going on the offensive (passive-aggressive). Deception technology creates traps (Honeypots, Honeytokens) to detect attackers and study their behavior.

### Learning Objectives
*   Deploy **Canary Tokens** (Honeytokens).
*   Understand **Honeypot** types (Low Interaction vs High Interaction).
*   Analyze attacker behavior in a trap.

## 2. Core Content

### Honeytokens (The Tripwire)
A file or credential that *should not be touched*.
1.  **AWS Key:** Place a fake `credentials` file on a laptop. If anyone uses it, AWS alerts you.
2.  **PDF/Word:** "Salary_Data.pdf". If opened, it beacons location.
3.  **Database Row:** A fake user "Admin_Backup". If queried, alert.

### Honeypots
1.  **Low Interaction:** Emulates a service (SSH banner). "I am an SSH server." Logs login attempts.
2.  **High Interaction:** A real VM. Let them hack it. Watch what they type. (Dangerous - needs isolation).

## 3. Lab: Canary in the Coal Mine
**Task:** Generate a Canary URL.
1.  Go to `canarytokens.org`.
2.  Create "Web Bug".
3.  Embed in an internal wiki page "Secret Project".
4.  Wait.
5.  Alert triggers: "IP 1.2.3.4 accessed Secret Project".

## 4. Completion Criteria
1.  **Define** "Honeytoken".
2.  **Explain** why High Interaction honeypots are risky.
