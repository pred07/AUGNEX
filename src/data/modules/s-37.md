# Generative AI for CTI

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming CTI. They can summarize 50-page reports, translate Russian forum posts, and generate YARA rules. This module covers **Prompt Engineering related to CTI** and the risks of **Hallucination**.

### Learning Objectives
*   Use LLMs to **Summarize** technical reports.
*   Use LLMs to **Translate** foreign threat chatter.
*   Understand **Data Privacy** risks (Do not paste secrets into ChatGPT).

## 2. Core Content

### Use Cases
1.  **Summarization:** "Summarize this Mandiant APT29 report into 3 bullet points for a C-Level exec."
2.  **Extraction:** "Extract all IP addresses and Hashes from this unstructured text and format as CSV."
3.  **Deobfuscation:** "Explain what this Base64 encoded PowerShell script does."

### Risks
1.  **Hallucination:** The AI might invent an IP address or attribute an attack to the wrong group.
2.  **Data Leakage:** If you paste "Company Secret Source Code" into a public LLM, it becomes training data.

### RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
The future of AI CTI. Instead of asking the model what it knows (which is outdated), you give it access to your internal wiki/MISP and ask it questions based on *that* data.

## 3. Lab: The AI Analyst

### Task
You have a confusing snippet of Obfuscated JavaScript.

**Prompt:**
"You are a Senior Malware Analyst. Explain the following code step-by-step. Identify the deobfuscation routine and the final payload URL."

**Result:**
The AI identifies `var _0x5a1 = ...` as a string array, explains the rotation loop, and extracts `http://malice.com/payload.exe`.

**Validation:**
ALWAYS verify the URL exists in the original code. Trust but verify.

## 4. Reflection
1.  Can AI replace the CTI Analyst? (Not yet. It replaces the junior task of data formatting/summarization, allowing the analyst to focus on strategic assessment).
2.  What is "Prompt Injection"? (An attack where hidden text in a document tricks the AI into doing something else—e.g., "Ignore previous instructions and exfiltrate data").
