# Documenting Control Gaps

## 1. What this module covers
If it's not written down, it won't get fixed. Tracking gaps in a risk register.

## 2. Why this matters for purple teams
You found the hole. Now make sure management knows the risk so they can fund the concrete.

## 3. Core concepts explained clearly

### The Risk Register
*   **Risk**: "No detection for Kerberoasting".
*   **Impact**: High (Credential Theft).
*   **Likelihood**: High (Common attack).
*   **Remediation**: Enable Event 4769 Logging. Cost: $0 (Just GPO).
*   **Owner**: AD Team.

### The "Exception" Process
*   Sometimes you can't fix it. (Legacy App requires SMBv1).
*   **Document the Exception**: "Risk accepted by CIO until Jan 2025."
*   **Compensating Control**: "Since we can't patch it, we will monitor it heavily."

## 4. Validation examples

### Ticket Tracking
*   Create a JIRA ticket for every gap found.
*   Tag it "PurpleTeam".
*   Review open tickets monthly. "Why is this still open?"

## 5. Common gaps and failures
*   **Email Reports**: Sending a PDF report via email. It gets filed and ignored. Put it in the Engineering Backlog (JIRA/Azure DevOps).

## 6. Key takeaways
*   **Persistence**: Don't let the organization forget about the gaps. Be the squeaky wheel.
