## 2. Core Content

### The Lesson: The Noise
*   **Blue teaches**: "We ignore Port 443 because there is too much data."
*   **Red learns**: "I hide in 443."

### The Lesson: Business Logic
*   **Blue teaches**: "The finance server always talks to the swift gateway at 2 AM."
*   **Red learns**: "If I attack at 2 AM, I blend in."

## 3. Guided Practice

### The Walkthrough
**Activity**: Blue takes Red on a tour of the SIEM.
*   "Look at this dashboard. See this spike? That's you."
*   Red realizes how loud they actually are.
*   Red improves their OPSEC, which in turn forces Blue to improve sensitivity.

3.  **Partnership**: Sharing this info builds massive trust.

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  Blue demos the **SIEM** to Red.
2.  Red understands **Detection Logic**.
3.  The **Simulation Quality** improves.
