# Communicating with Red and Blue Teams

## 1. What this module covers
Language. Culture. Diplomacy.

## 2. Why this matters for purple teams
Red Teamers are arrogant ("I broke your stuff"). Blue Teamers are defensive ("You cheated"). Purple Teamers must bridge this emotional gap.

## 3. Core concepts explained clearly

### The Common Ground
*   **Goal**: We both want to stop the *real* bad guy.
*   **Red**: "I am showing you where the holes are so you can fix them."
*   **Blue**: "Thank you for finding that before the Russians did."

### Reporting Styles
*   **Don't say**: "Blue team failed to detect X." (Blame).
*   **Say**: "Technique X was executed but logging verbosity was insufficient." (Clinical, Engineering problem).

## 4. Validation examples

### The "Debrief" Meeting
*   After the exercise, get pizza. Sit in the same room.
*   Walk through the timeline *together*.
*   Red: "At 10:01 I ran X."
*   Blue: "At 10:01 I say Y... oh wait, I filtered it out."
*   **Collaborate**: "How do we fix the filter?"

## 5. Common gaps and failures
*   **Secrets**: Red Team keeping their "Best Tricks" secret so they can win next year. (Counter-productive).
*   **Ego**: Blue Team "tuning for the test" (Hardcoding the Red Team IP) instead of fixing the vulnerability.

## 6. Key takeaways
*   **One Team**: There is no Red or Blue. There is only "Company Security".
