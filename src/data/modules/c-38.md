# Red Teaching Blue

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers specific skills Attackers transfer to Defenders.

### Fit in the Learning Path
"Know your enemy."

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **OPSEC**: How attackers hide.
*   **Evasion**: How tools are bypassed.
*   **Mindset**: Thinking in graphs, not lists.

---

## 2. Core Content

### The Lesson: Evasion
*   **Red teaches**: "If I change this one byte in the header, your signature fails."
*   **Blue learns**: "I need to look at behavior, not just static hashes."

### The Lesson: Living off the Land
*   **Red teaches**: "I don't need malware. I can use `certutil`."
*   **Blue learns**: "I need to monitor native tools, not just foreign executables."

## 3. Guided Practice

### The Workshop
**Topic**: Obfuscation.
1.  Red shows a clear PowerShell script.
2.  Red shows an encoded one.
3.  Red shows a logic-obfuscated one.
4.  Blue writes regex to catch all three (or realizes regex is futile and switches to AMSI logging).

---

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Humility**: Red must be willing to give away their secrets. "Burning" a technique is worth it if it improves defense.
2.  **Curiosity**: Blue must ask "How did you do that?" instead of "Stop doing that."
3.  **Growth**: Both sides get sharper.

---

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  Red conducts a **Teach-in**.
2.  Blue updates **Defense Logic** based on the lesson.
3.  The organization's **Resilience** increases.
