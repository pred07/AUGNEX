# Password Attacks and Credential Exposure

## 1. Unit Brief: The Keys to the Kingdom
Passwords are the primary defense for most systems. Attacking them is simple math. You either guess them (Brute Force), steal them (Phishing/Malware), or find them (Exposure).

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Credential Reuse**: Users use the same password for Netflix and their Bank. If Netflix leaks, the Bank is vulnerable.
*   **Weak Policy**: Setting `Password!1` satisfies "Capital, Number, Symbol" but is trivial to guess.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Storage (Hashing)
Passwords are not stored as text (hopefully). They are hashed (`MD5("password") -> 5f4d...`).
*   **Attack**: You steal the hash (SQLi). You then guess passwords offline, hash them, and compare.
*   **Salt**: Adding random data to the password before hashing to stop Rainbow Tables.

### Exposure
*   **History**: Browser saves passwords. Malware steals `Login Data` file.
*   **Git**: Hardcoded in source code.
*   **Config Files**: `web.config` often contains DB connection strings with passwords.

## 4. Practical Examples

### Hashcat (Offline Cracking)
1.  You dumped a Hashes: `admin:5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99` (MD5).
2.  Run Hashcat:
    ```bash
    $ hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hashes.txt rockyou.txt
    ```
3.  Hashcat tries millions of words per second.
4.  Result: `5f4d...:password`.

### John the Ripper
Similar to Hashcat. Good for weird formats (SSH keys, PDF passwords, Zip passwords).
`zip2john protected.zip > hash.txt`
`john hash.txt`

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Cracking Online**: Trying to guess hashed passwords by typing them into the login page.
    *   *Wrong*: You have the hash. Crack it locally on your GPU. It's 1000x faster.
*   **Password Complexity**: Assuming 8 characters is enough. GPUs can brute force 8-char lowercase in seconds.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Offline > Online**: Always try to steal the hash file (Shadow file, SAM database) for offline cracking.
*   **Wordlists**: Your success depends on your wordlist (`rockyou.txt` is the starter).
