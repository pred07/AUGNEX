# Cloud Security Shared Responsibility

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module defines who secures what in the Cloud. **IaaS**, **PaaS**, **SaaS**.

### Fit in the Learning Path
"It's in the cloud, so it's secure" is a lie. If you leave an S3 bucket open, Amazon is not responsible. You are.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   The **Shared Responsibility Model**.
*   **IaaS** (EC2) vs **SaaS** (Gmail).
*   The "Security of the Cloud" vs "Security in the Cloud".

## 2. Core Content

### The Division
*   **AWS (Provider)**: Responsible for the Concrete, the Power, the Hypervisor.
*   **You (Customer)**: Responsible for the Data, the OS (in EC2), the Firewalls, the Permissions.

### Service Models
1.  **IaaS (Infrastructure)**: You manage OS + Apps. (Max control, Max work).
2.  **PaaS (Platform)**: You manage Apps (RDS, Lambda). AWS manages OS.
3.  **SaaS (Software)**: You manage Data (Salesforce, O365). Provider does everything else.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Scenario: The Breach
**Event**: A hacker steals data from an AWS S3 Bucket.
**Cause**: The bucket permission was "Public".

**Who is at fault?**
*   **Customer**. AWS gave you the tool (Private by default), you turned off the safety.

**Event**: An AWS Datacenter burns down. Data is lost.
**Who is at fault?**
*   **AWS** (Unless you didn't replicate to a second region!).

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Complexity**: Why is Cloud harder than On-Prem? (Because everything is software defined. A single API call can expose the entire network).
2.  **Config**: Misconfiguration is the #1 Cloud Threat.
3.  **Trust**: We trust AWS not to peek at our data. (Encryption helps verification).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can draw the Responsibility Line.
2.  You understand that moving to SaaS reduces operational load but not Data responsibility.
3.  You stop blaming the cloud provider for bad configs.
