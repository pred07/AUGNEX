# Eradication and Recovery

## 1. Unit Brief: Surgery and Healing
*   **Eradication**: Removing the tumor. (Deleting malware, patching the hole, removing backdoor accounts).
*   **Recovery**: Rehab. (Restoring from backup, verifying function).

## 2. Real-World Relevance
If you restore from backup `Day-1`, but don't patch the vulnerability, the hacker just re-infects you `Day+1`.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Eradication Steps
1.  **Reimage**: Don't try to "clean" a virus. Wipe the drive. Reinstall Windows from a known good ISO.
2.  **Patch**: Apply the security update that was missing.
3.  **credential Reset**: Force password resets for ALL users (since you don't know who was compromised).

### Recovery Steps
1.  **Restore Data**: Pull from immutable backups.
2.  **Verify**: run scans. Is the malware gone?
3.  **Phased Return**: Bring systems online slowly. Watch logs like a hawk.

## 4. Practical Examples

### The "Nuke from Orbit"
"It's the only way to be sure."
*   Enterprise standard: If a machine behaves weirdly, re-image it. It costs 30 mins to re-image. It costs 5 days to analyze.

### The Golden Ticket Reset
If AD was compromised:
*   You must reset the `krbtgt` account password TWICE (to invalidate current and history tickets). Failing to do this means the hacker retains Admin access forever.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Restoring Infected Backups**: The hacker was in the network for 6 months. You restore a backup from last week. The backup contains the backdoor.
*   **Rushing**: Bringing the server back up before the patch is applied.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Trust Nothing**: A compromised machine is dead. New hardware/OS is the only trust.
*   **Validation**: Recovery is not done until the Business Owner signs off.
