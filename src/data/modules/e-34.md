# External vs Internal Network Penetration Testing

## 1. Unit Brief: The View from Outside vs Inside
The methodology changes drastically depending on where you are plugged in. External testing is about breaching the perimeter. Internal testing is about lateral movement and domain dominance.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **External**: "Can I get in?" (Simulating a hacker on the internet).
*   **Internal**: "How much damage can I do if I get in?" (Simulating a rogue employee or a successful phish).

## 3. Core Concepts

### External Testing
*   **High Noise**: You are hitting the firewall. IDS/IPS will signal.
*   **Focus**: Exploiting public-facing services (Web, VPN, Mail), Password Spraying, OSINT.
*   **Goal**: Initial Access (Shell).

### Internal Testing
*   **Assumed Breach**: You start with a laptop plugged into the office network (or a VPN connection).
*   **Focus**: Active Directory, File Shares (SMB), Man-in-the-Middle (LLMNR/NBT-NS), Vulnerable Workstations (BlueKeep).
*   **Goal**: Domain Admin.

## 4. Practical Examples

### The Perimeter Breach (External)
You find a forgotten Jenkins server on Port 8080 without a password. You execute a script to get a Reverse Shell. Now you are "Internal".

### The Lateral Move (Internal)
Now that you have a shell on the Jenkins server:
1.  Run `arp -a` to see neighbors.
2.  Scan the internal subnet `192.168.10.x`.
3.  Find a Windows Machine with SMB (Port 445) open.
4.  Use `Responder` to steal hashes or `EternalBlue` to exploit it.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Using Internal tools Externally**: Trying to run `Responder` (a Layer 2 attack) across the internet. It won't work.
*   **Underestimating the Firewall**: Externally, you might see 2 ports. Internally, you might see 50 ports on the same server.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Context is key**: Know your position in the network topology.
*   **Internal is "Chewy"**: Most networks are hard on the outside (Crunchy) and soft on the inside.
