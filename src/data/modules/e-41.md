# Password Spraying vs Brute Force Techniques

## 1. Unit Brief: Stealth vs Noise
When attacking a live login page (Online Attack), you fight the Account Lockout Policy. Brute Force (Trying many passwords against one user) locks the account. Password Spraying (Trying one password against many users) bypasses it.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Scenario**: Active Directory enforces "Lockout after 5 failed attempts".
*   **Brute Force**: Try 6 passwords on `admin`. Account Locked. Blue Team Alarmed.
*   **Spray**: Try `SeasonYear!` (e.g., `Winter2024!`) on ALL 5,000 employees.
*   **Result**: 20 employees picked that weak password. You get 20 valid accounts. Zero lockouts.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Brute Force
*   **Target**: One specific high-value user (Admin).
*   **Method**: `admin:123`, `admin:password`, `admin:qwerty`...
*   **Risk**: High lockout risk.

### Password Spraying
*   **Target**: The entire organization.
*   **Method**: `User1:Spring2025!`, `User2:Spring2025!`, `User3:Spring2025!`...
*   **Success Rate**: Surprisingly high due to predictable human behavior.

### Credential Stuffing
*   **Target**: Specific user.
*   **Method**: Using the exact password they lost in a previous breach (LinkedIn leak).

## 4. Practical Examples

### Using Hydra for Spraying
We have a list of users `users.txt`. Password is `Password123`.
```bash
$ hydra -L users.txt -p Password123 ssh://target.com
```

### CrackMapExec (SMB Spray)
The industry standard for AD spraying.
```bash
$ crackmapexec smb 192.168.1.0/24 -u users.txt -p 'Winter2024!'
```
*   If it returns `[+]` (Green), you have a valid login.
*   If it says `(Pwn3d!)`, you have Admin rights.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Spraying "password"**: Too common. Some policies forbid the word "password". Use seasonal variations (`Summer2023!`).
*   **Ignoring Lockout Policy**: You must know the policy (e.g., 5 attempts in 30 mins) to time your spray. Spray once every hour.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Spray to Init**: Spraying is usually the best way to get that first foothold in a domain.
*   **Low and Slow**: Patience wins. Speed kills (your access).
