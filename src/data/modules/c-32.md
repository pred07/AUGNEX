# Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)

## 1. What this module covers
How long until the bleeding stops. Speed of Containment.

## 2. Why this matters for purple teams
Detecting the fire is step 1. Putting it out is step 2. If you detect it in 1 minute but take 4 hours to block the IP, the data is gone.

## 3. Core concepts explained clearly

### Definition
*   **Start**: Analyst opens ticket (T1).
*   **End**: Threat is contained (e.g., Host isolated, User disabled) (T2).
*   **MTTR = T2 - T1**.

### The 1-10-60 Rule
*   **1 Minute**: to Detect.
*   **10 Minutes**: to Investigate.
*   **60 Minutes**: to Respond (Contain).

## 4. Validation examples

### Response Drill
1.  **Scenario**: "Active Ransomware on Host A".
2.  **Action**: Isolate Host A from the network.
3.  **Method**:
    *   *Manual*: Call the Network Team. "Please shutdown port 5". (Time: 45 mins).
    *   *EDR Console*: Right-click -> Isolate. (Time: 2 mins).
4.  **Result**: Automation wins.

## 5. Common gaps and failures
*   **Permissions**: Analyst sees the attack but doesn't have "Admin" rights to disable the user. They have to wake up the IT Manager. (Delay = 3 hours).

## 6. Key takeaways
*   **Empowerment**: Incident Responders need the "Keys to the Kingdom" during an emergency.
