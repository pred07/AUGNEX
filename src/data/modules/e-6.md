# Information Gathering Principles

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module kicks off the Reconnaissance phase. We define the difference between **Passive** (Invisible) and **Active** (Visible) information gathering.

### Fit in the Learning Path
You cannot hit what you cannot see. Info Gathering is often 90% of the engagement. If you do this well, the exploit is trivial.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   The risk of touching the target.
*   What "OSINT" actually means.
*   The danger of "Touching the Glass" (Alerting the SOC).

## 2. Core Content

### Passive Reconnaissance
Gathering info *without* sending a single packet to the target's network.
*   **Sources**: Google, LinkedIn, Whois, Shodan, Wayback Machine.
*   **Risk**: Zero. The target generally cannot know you are looking at them.

### Active Reconnaissance
Directly interacting with the target.
*   **Actions**: Port Scanning (Nmap), Fuzzing, Banner Grabbing.
*   **Risk**: High. Your IP is in their logs. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) will fire.

### The Cycle
1.  **Passive First**: Build a map of potential targets.
2.  **Narrow Down**: Choose the weakest looking targets.
3.  **Active Second**: Scan only specifically what you need.

## 3. Guided Practice

### The "Touching the Glass" Analogy
Imagine you are robbing a museum.

*   **Passive**: reading the museum's brochure, checking Google Maps for exits, looking at employee LinkedIn profiles to see who is the guard.
    *   *Can they catch you?* No. You are just a tourist.

*   **Active**: Walking up to a window and shaking it to see if it's locked.
    *   *Can they catch you?* Yes. You just set off a vibration sensor.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Stealth**: Why do Red Teamers spend weeks on Passive Recon before running a single Nmap scan? (To avoid burning their cover).
2.  **Noise**: Is `ping google.com` Active or Passive? (Active. You sent a packet to Google).
3.  **Logs**: If you visit the target's website `www.company.com`, is that Active or Passive? (Active, technically. Your IP is in their Apache/Nginx logs, but it looks like normal traffic).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can classify an action as Passive or Active.
2.  You understand that Active Recon initiates the "Combat" phase (Defense can see you).
3.  You commit to exhausting Passive sources first.
