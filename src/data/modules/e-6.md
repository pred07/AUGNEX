# Information Gathering Principles

## 1. Unit Brief: The Art of Knowing
Information gathering is the most critical phase of any offensive operation. It is the foundation upon which every subsequent attack is built. An exploit is only as good as the target intelligence it is fired at. If you attack blindly, you will fail or get caught.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Pentester**: "I found a hidden admin portal because I read the company's job postings mentioning they use 'CustomApp v2'."
*   **Script Kiddie**: "I ran Nmap on the main IP and found nothing."
*   **Result**: The pro wins because they gathered better intel.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Passive vs. Active
*   **Passive Reconnaissance**: Gathering info *without* touching the target's infrastructure. (e.g., Reading LinkedIn, checking DNS records, using Shodan). **Undetectable**.
*   **Active Reconnaissance**: Touching the target. (e.g., Nmap scanning, directory busting, banner grabbing). **Detectable** by IDS/IPS.

### "Garbage In, Garbage Out"
If your target list is incomplete, your vulnerability scan will be incomplete.
*   **Example**: You miss a subplot of IP addresses because you didn't check the ASN. You missed the vulnerability that was sitting on `192.168.1.55`.

## 4. Practical Examples

### Scenario: The LinkedIn Leak vs The Nmap Scan
*   **Active**: You scan `company.com` and find Port 80 open. Apache 2.4.
*   **Passive**: You search LinkedIn for "System Administrator at Company". You find a post: "Excited to be deploying our new JBoss server!".
*   **Synthesis**: You now search for JBoss instances on their network, specifically looking for the default port 8080. You find it on a different subdomain.

### Terminal Context: What am I looking for?
*   **IP Addresses**
*   **Subdomains**
*   **Employee Names/Emails**
*   **Technology Stack** (BuiltWith)
*   **Cloud Provider** (AWS, Azure)

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Skipping Recon**: Rushing to fire up Metasploit before knowing what the target is.
*   **Being too Loud**: Running aggressive active scans before doing passive recon, triggering the firewall to block you immediately.
*   **Ignoring Non-Technical Intel**: Ignoring job postings, news articles, or press releases that reveal software versions.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Spend 60% of your time on Recon**.
*   **Passive first, Active second**.
*   **Knowledge is Power**: The more you know about the target, the less "hacking" you actually have to do.
