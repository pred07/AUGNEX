# Measuring Detection Coverage

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers the **Scorecard**. How to report "We are 60% secure".

### Fit in the Learning Path
Executives love numbers. Give them meaningful ones.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **The Coverage Map**.
*   **Depth scoring**.
*   **Trending**.

## 2. Core Content

### The Metric
"Percentage of MITRE Techniques with at least one validated detection."
*   Current: 20%.
*   Goal (Q4): 30%.

### Depth Scoring
Just having a rule isn't enough.
*   **Level 1**: Logged. (We see it).
*   **Level 2**: Alerted. (We know it).
*   **Level 3**: Blocked. (We stopped it).

**Calculation**:
Technique T1003: Level 3 (Blocked).
Technique T1059: Level 1 (Logged).

## 3. Guided Practice

### Building the Report
**Executive Summary**:
"This quarter, the Purple Team validated 50 attack techniques. We identified gaps in **Lateral Movement** detection."

**Stats**:
*   Attacks Simulated: 50.
*   Blocked: 10. (20%).
*   Detected: 30. (60%).
*   Missed: 10. (20%). -> **Focus Area**.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Honesty**: Don't fudge the numbers. If you missed 50%, say so. It justifies budget for better tools.
2.  **Reality**: You will never reach 100%. (New techniques appear daily).
3.  **Focus**: 100% coverage of "Ransomware" techniques is better than 10% coverage of everything.

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You track **Detection Percentage**.
2.  You differentiate between **Logged** and **Blocked**.
3.  You use trending charts to show improvement over time.
