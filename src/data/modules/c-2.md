# Red vs Blue Mental Models

## 1. What this module covers
Understanding the fundamental differences in how Attackers (Red) and Defenders (Blue) view the same network. Merging these views creates the "Purple" perspective.

## 2. Why this matters for purple teams
To build effective defenses, you must think like an attacker. To execute meaningful attacks, you must understand defensive constraints.

## 3. Core concepts explained clearly

### The Map
*   **Blue View**: Topology diagrams, Asset lists, Organizational Units, Compliance checklists. "We are secure because we have a Firewall."
*   **Red View**: Attack Graphs, Relationships, Misconfigurations. "I am Domain Admin because the Printer Service account has a weak password."

### The "Graph"
*   Attackers think in **Graphs** (Nodes and Edges). "If I compromise Node A, I can reach Node B."
*   Defenders often think in **Lists** (Patch lists, Vulnerability scan results).
*   *Purple View*: Using the Defensive List to break the Attacker's Graph.

## 4. Validation examples

### The "Assumed Breach" Scenario
*   **Blue Fear**: "What if they get past the Firewall?"
*   **Red Reality**: "I am already past the Firewall via Phishing."
*   **Purple Test**: Assume the endpoint is compromised. Start the test from an internal laptop.
*   **Validation**: Can Blue detect lateral movement from User A to Server B?
    *   *Query*: `EventCode=4624 LogonType=3 SourceIP=User_Laptop`

## 5. Common gaps and failures
*   **Protecting the wrong thing**: Blue protects the "Crown Jewels" (Database) heavily but leaves the "Keys" (Admin Workstation) exposed. Red steals the keys and walks into the vault.
*   **Alert Fatigue**: Blue tunes out alerts because they don't understand the *context* of the attack. Red knows this and hides in the noise.

## 6. Key takeaways
*   **Converge**: Stop thinking "How do I block this?" and start thinking "How would I exploit this, and what trace would it leave?".
*   **Context**: Security is not a product; it's a state of being relative to the adversary.
