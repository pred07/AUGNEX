# Red vs Blue Mental Models

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module contrasts the mindset. **Attackers think in Graphs**. **Defenders think in Lists**.

### Fit in the Learning Path
To build better defenses, you must empathize with the attacker. To attack better, you must understand the defender's constraints.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **The Defender's Dilemma**: They have to be right 100% of the time.
*   **The Attacker's Advantage**: They only have to be right once.
*   **Path of Least Resistance**.

## 2. Core Content

### The List vs The Graph
*   **Blue**: "I have a list of assets. I need to patch 1,000 servers. I have a list of vulnerabilities."
*   **Red**: "I don't care about 999 servers. I just need a path from the Internet to the Domain Controller." (Graph).

### Time
*   **Blue**: Works 9-5. Has meetings. Dealing with change management.
*   **Red**: Works whenever. No change management. Speed is key.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Thinking Like the Other Side
**Scenario**: A new Critical Vulnerability in `Apache Struts`.

**Blue Thought**:
"Oh no. I have to find all instances, test the patch, schedule downtime, and deploy." (Process-heavy).

**Red Thought**:
"I just need to find ONE unpatched server before they finish their process." (Race condition).

**Purple Thought**:
"Blue, can you block the specific HTTP header used by the exploit at the WAF *while* you patch?" (Strategic mitigation).

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Asymmetry**: Is the game fair? (No. Attackers have the initiative. Defenders have the terrain).
2.  **Constraints**: Red Teams often ignore "production stability". Blue Teams live by it.
3.  **Burnout**: Understanding the "Defender's Dilemma" helps Red Teams be less arrogant.

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You stop judging Blue Teams for "Missing a patch".
2.  You understand why Attackers love **Graph Theory**.
3.  You see how **Purple Teaming** aligns the mental models.
