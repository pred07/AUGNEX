# File and Process Management

## Managing Files

Sometimes we need to move, copy, or delete things.

1.  **`cp source destination`** (Copy)
    *   `cp virus.exe backup_virus.exe`
2.  **`mv source destination`** (Move/Rename)
    *   `mv virus.exe /tmp/`
    *   `mv oldname.txt newname.txt`
3.  **`rm file`** (Remove/Delete)
    *   `rm debris.log`
    *   **Warning**: `rm -rf /` will delete your entire computer. Be careful.

## Managing Processes

Sometimes a program freezes or you need to stop a background service.

1.  **`ps aux`**
    *   List all running processes.
2.  **`kill [PID]`**
    *   Stop a process gracefully.
    *   `kill 1234`
3.  **`kill -9 [PID]`**
    *   **Force Kill**. The "End Task" of Linux. Use this if it refuses to die.

## Finding Files

1.  **`locate file`**: Fast, uses a database.
2.  **`find / -name file`**: Slow, searches live disk. Powerful.

## Why This Matters

When you get a shell on a victim machine, you need to upload your tools (`cp`/`mv`), find passwords (`find`), and hide your tracks (`rm`).
