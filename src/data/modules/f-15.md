# File and Process Management

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers manipulation. Creating, deleting, finding files, and managing running processes via the CLI.

### Fit in the Learning Path
After navigation comes interaction. You need to know how to create scripts, delete logs, and kill stuck tools.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   File Ops: `touch`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv`.
*   Process Ops: `ps`, `top`, `kill`.
*   Searching: `find`.

---

## 2. Core Content

### File Manipulation
*   **touch**: Creates empty file.
*   **mkdir**: Creates directory.
*   **cp**: Copy. (`cp source dest`).
*   **mv**: Move (OR Rename). (`mv old new`).
*   **rm**: Remove. **Danger**: `rm -rf` deletes recursively and forcefully. There is no Recycle Bin.

### Process Management
*   **top** / **htop**: Task Manager. Shows CPU/RAM.
*   **ps aux**: Snapshot of all processes.
*   **kill [PID]**: Terminates a process.

## 3. Guided Practice

### The "Create and Destroy" Cycle
We will create a directory structure and then wipe it out.

**Step 1: Setup**
```bash
cd ~
mkdir lab_test
cd lab_test
```

**Step 2: Create Files**
```bash
touch file1.txt
touch file2.txt
mkdir subfolder
```

**Step 3: Move and Rename**
```bash
mv file1.txt subfolder/moved_file.txt
ls -R
```
(Recursively lists to confirm).

**Step 4: Destruction**
Go back one level and nuke it.
```bash
cd ..
rm -rf lab_test
```
**Verify**: `ls lab_test` should say "No such file".

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Accidents**: Why is `rm -rf /` the most infamous command in Linux history?
2.  **Sudo**: If you try to `kill` a process owned by Root, what happens? (Operation not permitted).
3.  **Find**: How would you find a file named `password.txt` anywhere on the system? (Hint: `find / -name password.txt`).

---

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You have successfully renamed a file using `mv`.
2.  You have successfully deleted a non-empty directory using `rm -r`.
3.  You respect the power of `rm`.
