# SOAR and Automation

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)**. Robots helping humans.

### Fit in the Learning Path
You cannot manually block 10,000 IPs. You need a script. SOAR is the script engine.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Orchestration**: Coordinating tools (SIEM talks to Firewall).
*   **Automation**: Running finding without humans.
*   **Playbooks**.

## 2. Core Content

### The Problem
*   Alert comes in.
*   Analyst copies IP.
*   Pastes into VirusTotal.
*   Pastes into Firewall.
*   emails User.
*   *Time*: 20 minutes.

### The Solution (SOAR)
*   Alert comes in.
*   SOAR automatically checks VirusTotal.
*   If Score > 10, SOAR update Firewall.
*   SOAR emails User.
*   *Time*: 1 second.

### Tools
*   **Palo Alto XSOAR**.
*   **Splunk SOAR (Phantom)**.
*   **Tines** (No-code automation).

## 3. Guided Practice

### Designing a Playbook
**Trigger**: Phishing Email Reported.

**Step 1**: Extract Attachment.
**Step 2**: Detonate in Sandbox (Cuckoo).
**Step 3**: If Malicious -> Delete email from Inbox of ALL users (Exchange API).
**Step 4**: Alert Analyst "Requires Review".

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Danger**: What if the automation goes wrong? (You accidentally block the CEO's home IP or delete legal emails. Always have "Human in the Loop" for destructive actions initially).
2.  **Enrichment**: What is Enrichment? (Adding context. The IP is just numbers. "GeoIP: Russia, Owner: EvilCorp" is enrichment).
3.  **Skills**: Do you need coding? (Yes. Python is the language of SOAR. Or complex Logic flows).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You view repetitive tasks as an enemy.
2.  You understand that SOAR buys **Time**.
3.  You acknowledge the risk of "Automated Stupidity".
