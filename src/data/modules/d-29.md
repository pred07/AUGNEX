# Phishing and Social Engineering

## 1. Unit Brief: Hacking Humans
Social Engineering is manipulating people into divulging confidential information or performing actions. Phishing is doing it via Email.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **CEO Fraud**: Email from "CEO" to CFO: "Wire $50k to this account immediately. It's urgent." (BEC - Business Email Compromise). Loss: Millions.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Types of Phishing
*   **Spear Phishing**: Targeted at ONE person. "Hi Bob, I liked your talk at the Miami Conference..."
*   **Whaling**: Targeted at Executives.
*   **Vishing**: Voice Phishing (Phone call).
*   **Smishing**: SMS Phishing.

### Red Flags
*   **Urgency**: "Account suspended! Act NOW!"
*   **Authority**: "This is the CEO."
*   **Curiosity**: "Payroll_2024_Bonus.xlsx".

## 4. Practical Examples

### Analyzing Email Headers
*   **Return-Path**: `<evil@hacker.com>`
*   **From**: `HR <hr@company.com>`
*   **Analysis**: Mismatch. The "From" address is spoofed.
*   **DMARC/SPF**: Security protocols that check if the sending server is authorized to send email for `@company.com`.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Blaming the User**: "The user is stupid." No, the phish was sophisticated. Educate, don't blame.
*   **Clicking 'Unsubscribe'**: On spam emails, this just confirms your email is active.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Verify**: Call the sender (on a known number) to verify urgent requests.
*   **Filters**: Technology (Email Gateways) stops 99%. Training stops the 1%.
