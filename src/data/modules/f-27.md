# Security Standards, Compliance, Ethics, and Law

## Introduction

This is the most boring but most dangerous module. Ignorance of the law is not a defense. If you hack the wrong thing, you go to jail.

## The Law

### Authorization is Everything
*   **Unauthorized Access**: It is illegal to access a computer system without permission.
*   **Scope**: Even if you have permission, if you go *outside* the scope (e.g., attacking the production server instead of the test server), you are liable.

## Frameworks & Standards

Companies don't just "do security"; they follow standards.

### 1. NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
The US Standard.
1.  **Identify**: Know what you have.
2.  **Protect**: Lock it down.
3.  **Detect**: Spot the bad guys.
4.  **Respond**: Kicking them out.
5.  **Recover**: Fixing the mess.

### 2. ISO/IEC 27001
The International Standard. It focuses on **ISMS** (Information Security Management System). It's about paperwork, process, and continuous improvement.

### 3. CIS Controls
Technical checklist. "Do these 18 things to be safe." (e.g., Inventory, Data Protection, Secure Config).

## Ethics

As a White Hat (Ethical Hacker), you hold a lot of power.
1.  **Do no harm**: Don't crash the client's server.
2.  **Privacy**: If you find user data (credit cards, emails), you report it. You never copy it.
3.  **Transparency**: You report exactly what you found. You don't hide findings.
