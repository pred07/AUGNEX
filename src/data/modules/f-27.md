# Security Standards, Compliance, Ethics, and Law

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module defines the boundaries. What is legal? What is ethical? And what frameworks like **NIST** and **GDPR** govern our industry.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Technical skills without ethics making you a criminal. Technical skills without compliance making you unemployable.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **CFAA** (Computer Fraud and Abuse Act).
*   **Authorization**: The only difference between hacking and auditing.
*   **Frameworks**: NIST, ISO 27001, GDPR.

## 2. Core Content

### The Law: CFAA (US)
*   **Unauthorized Access**: Accessing a computer without permission is a federal crime.
*   **Exceeding Access**: You have permission to read email, but you read HR payroll. Crime.
*   **Intent**: Does not matter. Curiosity is not a defense.

### The Paperwork: Frameworks
Companies don't just "do security". They follow standards.
*   **NIST CSF**: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover. (The standard).
*   **GDPR / CCPA**: Privacy laws. "You must protect user data."
*   **PCI-DSS**: Credit Card security standards.

### Ethics
*   **White Hat**: Valid permission. Helps.
*   **Black Hat**: No permission. Harms.
*   **Gray Hat**: No permission. Tries to help. (Still Illegal).

## 3. Guided Practice

### The "Get Out of Jail Free" Card
Every legitimate security engagement starts with a **ROE (Rules of Engagement)** or a **Scope of Work**.

**Document Review (Mental)**:
Before you touch a keyboard, you need a signed document stating:
1.  **Who**: Client Name.
2.  **What**: Target IP ranges.
3.  **When**: Testing window (e.g., 9am-5pm).
4.  **Authorization**: "I authorize [Name] to test..."

**Rule**: If it is not in the scope, do not touch it.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Gray Areas**: You find a bug in Google. Do you tweet it? Or do you submit to their Bug Bounty Program? (Bug Bounty. Tweeting it gives it to Black Hats).
2.  **Scope Creep**: During a test, you find the client's data on a 3rd party server (AWS). Can you hack that AWS bucket? (No. You don't have permission from AWS or the owner).
3.  **Responsibility**: If you write ransomware "for research" and it leaks and destroys a hospital, are you responsible? (Yes).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You understand that **Written Permission** is mandatory.
2.  You know the term "Scope".
3.  You are ready to proceed to the **EXPLOIT** or **PROTECTOR** path with a professional mindset.
