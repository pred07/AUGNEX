# Attribution: The Art of "Who done it?"

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
Attribution is the process of identifying the actor behind an attack. It is the most politically charged and technically difficult part of CTI. This module covers the **Levels of Attribution**, **False Flags**, and why "Who Analysis" (naming the actor) is often less important than "How Analysis" (stopping the TTP).

### Learning Objectives
*   Understand the **levels of confidence** in attribution.
*   Analyze **technical artifacts** vs **strategic context**.
*   Identify **False Flag** operations designed to deceive analysts.

## 2. Core Content

### Can you *really* know?
An IP address only tells you which computer sent the packet, not who was sitting in the chair. Attribution is almost always probabilistic, not deterministic.

### The Hierarchy of Attribution Indicators
1.  **Low Confidence:** IP Addresses (Proxies), Domain Names (Registrars).
2.  **Medium Confidence:** Toolsets (Malware families), Infrastructure overlap (Reused SSL certs).
3.  **High Confidence:** Use of Non-Public Exploits (0-days), Language artifacts in code, Time zone analysis, Strategic alignment (Geopolitics).

### False Flags
Sophisticated actors (APTs) *deliberately* plant evidence to frame others.
*   *Example:* The "Olympic Destroyer" malware contained code fragments from North Korean malware (Lazarus) but was actually written by Russia (Sandworm).

### The "Attribution Paradox"
*   **Strategic Level:** Attribution is crucial. (A nation-state needs to know who to sanction).
*   **Tactical Level:** Attribution is irrelevant. ('I don't care if it's Russia or China; I just need to block their lateral movement').

## 3. Lab: The Evidence Board

### Scenario
You are analyzing a breach at a Defense Contractor. You find:

1.  **Time:** Attacks occurred between 08:00 and 17:00 Beijing Time.
2.  **Tool:** A custom RAT seen only in APT10 campaigns.
3.  **String:** A PDB path in the binary: `C:\Users\Wang\Project\Dev...`

**Assessment:**
*   The Timezone matches China.
*   The Tool matches APT10.
*   The String implies a Chinese name.

**Verdict:** High Confidence: APT10.

**Devilish Twist:**
What if the attacker *compiled the binary on a machine with the timezone set to Beijing* to trick you? This is why we need **multiple independent sources** of evidence.

## 4. Reflection
1.  Why is the PDB path `C:\Users\Wang\...` suspicious as a "Too Good To Be True" indicator? (Professional malware authors rarely leave their home directory paths in final builds unless they are sloppy or it's a false flag).
2.  Why is "Infrastructure Overlap" (e.g., reusing an SSH key) a strong indicator? ( Attackers are lazy. Setting up new servers takes time. Reusing a key links two separate campaigns irrevocably).
