# Tracking Threat Actors & Campaigns

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
Moving from individual alerts to "Campaigns". This connects the dots over time.

### Learning Objectives
*   Define a **Campaign** (Temporal cluster of activity).
*   Practice **Actor Naming** discipline.
*   Create a **Threat Profile**.

## 2. Core Content

### Campaign vs Incident
*   **Incident:** One breach.
*   **Campaign:** A series of breaches with shared TTPs/Goals. (e.g., "The SolarWinds Campaign").
*   **Threat Actor:** The human/group behind the campaign.

### Clustering Strategy
1.  **Code Reuse:** Do binaries share unique functions?
2.  **Infrastructure:** Do domains resolve to the same subnet?
3.  **Targeting:** Is it always Energy triggers?
4.  **Temporal:** Do they always work 9-5 Moscow time?

### Naming (UNC groups)
*   **UNC (Uncategorized):** Mandiant standard. "UNC1234".
*   **Merge:** When UNC1234 matches UNC999, merge them.
*   **Attribution:** When UNC1234 is confirmed as GRU Unit 74455, rename to "Sandworm".
