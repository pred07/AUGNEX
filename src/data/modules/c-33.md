## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers **Wikis**, **Playbooks**, and **Runbooks**.

### Fit in the Learning Path
If the smart person leaves, does the security leave with them?

## 2. Core Content

### The Central Brain
Documentation is not optional. It is the legacy.
*   **Runbook**: "Click-by-click instructions to restart the firewall." (Tactical).
*   **Playbook**: "Strategy for handling a Ransomware Infection." (Strategic).

### The AAR
After every incident (Simulated or Real):
1.  What happened?
2.  What went well?
3.  What failed?
4.  How do we fix it?

## 3. Guided Practice

### Creating a Detection Entry
**Template**:
*   *Title*: T1003 - LSASS Dumping.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Searchability**: A wiki no one searches is dead. keywording matters.
2.  **Updates**: A stale runbook is dangerous. Schedule quarterly reviews.
3.  **Culture**: "If it's not in the wiki, it didn't happen."

---

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You maintain a **Security Wiki**.
2.  You write **AARs** after exercises.
3.  You document **False Positives** for future analysts.
