# Users, Groups, and Access Control

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module defines "Identity" on a computer. It explains how the OS tracks humans (Users) and teams (Groups) to enforce security boundaries.

### Fit in the Learning Path
"Hacking" often means stealing an Identity (Credential Theft) to access resources you shouldn't have. You need to know how the OS validates that identity.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **UID / GID** (Linux Unique IDs).
*   **SID** (Windows Security IDs).
*   Why the "Administrator" account is special (UID 0 / SID 500).

## 2. Core Content

### The Concept of Identity
The computer doesn't know your name is "Bob". It knows your ID number.

### Linux Identity
*   **Root**: The God User. Always **UID 0**.
*   **System Users**: UID 1-999. Services like `www-data` (Web Server) or `daemon`.
*   **Regular Users**: UID 1000+. Your account (`kali`).
*   **Groups**: A way to share permissions. If `Bob` and `Alice` are in group `Developers`, they can both read project files.

### Windows Identity
*   **SID (Security Identifier)**: A long string like `S-1-5-21-...-500`.
*   **RID (Relative ID)**: The last part of the SID.
    *   **500**: Administrator (Always).
    *   **501**: Guest.
    *   **1000+**: Regular Users.

### Access Control
*   **Authentication**: "Who are you?" (Password, Key).
*   **Authorization**: "Are you allowed to do this?" (Checking the UID/SID against the file's permissions).

## 3. Guided Practice

### Who Am I? (Deep Dive)
We will look beyond the username.

**Linux Step 1: Check ID**
Run:
```bash
id
```
*   **Output**: `uid=1000(kali) gid=1000(kali) groups=1000(kali),27(sudo)...`
*   **Analysis**: You are UID 1000. You are a member of the `sudo` group (which lets you become UID 0 temporarily).

**Linux Step 2: Check the Registry**
The list of all users is a plain text file.
Run:
```bash
cat /etc/passwd | head
```
*   **Format**: `root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash`
*   **Observation**: You can see `root` is 0.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Privilege Escalation**: If you find a way to change your UID to 0, what have you achieved?
2.  **Persistence**: If an attacker creates a user named "Support", but the UID is 0, is it a "Support" user or a "Root" user?
3.  **Groups**: Why is the `docker` group often considered dangerous in Linux? (Research: "Docker Group Privilege Escalation").

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You have run the `id` command and analyzed the output.
2.  You know that **UID 0** is the target for Linux attacks.
3.  You understand that Groups are used to manage permissions for multiple users at once.
