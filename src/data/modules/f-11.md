# Users, Groups, and Access Control

## Introduction

Computers are multi-user environments. Even your personal laptop has multiple "users" running in the background to separate privileges.

## The Root User

In Linux, there is a god-mode account called `root` (UID 0).
*   Can read any file.
*   Can kill any process.
*   Can change any password.

> **Security Rule**: Never log in as root for daily tasks. Use a standard user and escalate only when needed (using `sudo`).

## Windows Equivalent

In Windows, the equivalent is `SYSTEM` or `Administrator`.

## Groups

Managing permission for 1000 users one by one is impossible. We use **Groups**.
*   **Admins**: People who can change settings.
*   **Sales**: People who can read the sales folder.
*   **Developers**: People who can write code.

You add a user to a group, and they inherit the permissions.

## Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)

This is the most important concept in defensive security.

**"A user should only have the bare minimum permissions necessary to do their job."**

*   A web server should not have permission to delete system backups.
*   A gamer should not have permission to edit Windows Registry by default.

## Why This Matters

If you hack a web server, you usually land as the `www-data` user (a low-level account). Your first goal is to check: "Does this user have any permissions they shouldn't?" (e.g., can I run `sudo` without a password?).
