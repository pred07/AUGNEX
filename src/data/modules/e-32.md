# Web Proxy Methodology (Burp Suite / ZAP)

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers the **Intercepting Proxy**. The cockpit of the web hacker. We focus on **Burp Suite** (Industry Standard) and **OWASP ZAP** (Open Source Alternative).

### Fit in the Learning Path
You cannot hack the modern web with a browser alone. `F12` is not enough. You need to stop time, modify packets, and replay them.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Repeater**: Modify and Resend.
*   **Intruder**: Fuzzing automation.
*   **Proxy History**: The log of everything.

## 2. Core Content

### The Setup
Browser -> Proxy (Localhost:8080) -> Internet.
*   Also requires installing a **CA Certificate** so the proxy can decrypt HTTPS.

### Key Features (Burp)
1.  **Proxy**: Intercepts requests in flight. "Forward" or "Drop".
2.  **Repeater**: The lab bench. Send a request, change one byte, send again.
3.  **Intruder**: The machine gun. Send 1000 requests with different payloads.
4.  **Decoder**: Base64/URL encode/decode helper.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Repeater Workflow
**Task**: Test for SQLi.

1.  Browse to login page.
2.  In Burp Proxy history, right-click the `POST /login` -> **Send to Repeater**.
3.  Go to Repeater tab.
4.  Change `user=admin` to `user=admin'`.
5.  Click **Send**.
6.  Check Response. Did it error?
7.  Change `user=admin'` to `user=admin'--`.
8.  Click **Send**.
9.  Rinse and repeat 50 times.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **HTTPS**: Why does the browser warn "Connection Untrusted" without the CA Cert? (Because Burp is performing a Man-in-the-Middle attack on you. You must trust Burp to proceed).
2.  **Scope**: Why configure scope in Burp? (To avoid accidentally logging gigabytes of data from Spotify/YouTube running in the background, or hacking sites you don't have permission for).
3.  **Extensions**: What is the BApp Store? ( Community plugins. e.g., "Authorize" for testing IDORs automatically).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You have successfully intercepted a request.
2.  You treat **Repeater** as your home.
3.  You have set up a FoxyProxy (or similar) switch.
