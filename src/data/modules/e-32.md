# Web Proxy Methodology (Burp Suite / ZAP)

## 1. Unit Brief: The Man in the Middle
You cannot hack web applications effectively with just a browser. You need to intercept, pause, modify, and replay the traffic. This is what a Web Proxy (Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP) does. It sits between your browser and the server.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **The Browser**: Lies to you. It hides headers, validates input, and renders HTML.
*   **The Proxy**: Shows raw truth. Raw HTTP. No validation.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Interception (Proxy)
Pausing a request before it leaves your computer.
*   Edit `price=100` to `price=0`.
*   Forward the request.

### Repeater (Burp) / Request Editor
Sending the same request over and over again with small modifications to test how the server responds.
*   "What if I add a single quote?"
*   "What if I remove the cookie?"

### Intruder (Burp) / Fuzzer
Automating attacks.
*   "Try these 10,000 passwords on this login form."
*   "Try these 5,000 directory names."

## 4. Practical Examples

### Bypassing Client-Side Validation
Form says: "Password must be 8 chars". JavaScript prevents you from clicking Submit.
1.  Type "12345678" (Valid).
2.  Click Submit.
3.  **Intercept** in Proxy.
4.  Change password in the raw text to "123".
5.  Forward.
6.  **Result**: The server receives "123". If the server doesn't check length, you bypassed the rule.

### Finding Logic Flaws with History
Filter the HTTP History by "Parametrized Requests". Look for weird parameters logic.
*   You see `is_admin=false` in a request you didn't notice before.
*   Send to Repeater -> Change to `true` -> Send.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Not installing the CA Certificate**: HTTPS traffic will fail without the Proxy's certificate installed in the browser.
*   **Scope issues**: Intercepting Google/Facebook traffic instead of the target. Configure your "Target Scope" immediately.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Burp is Life**: Professional pentesters live in Burp Suite. Learn the hotkeys (`Ctrl+R` to Repeater).
*   **ZAP is Free**: A great open-source alternative.
