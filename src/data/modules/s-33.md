# Automating Collection with APIs

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
Building a pipeline. Connecting your feeds directly to your tools.

### Learning Objectives
*   Understand **REST APIs**.
*   Handle **Rate Limits**.
*   Build a **Daily Briefing Bot**.

---

## 2. Core Content

### The API Economy
Every tool (Shodan, VT, Recorded Future) has an API.
*   **Authentication:** API Keys (Keep them secret!).
*   **Endpoints:** The URL you hit (`/v1/search`).
*   **Rate Limits:** You can only ask 4 times per minute. Your script must `sleep()`.

### Use Case: The Slack Bot
Imagine a bot that checks for new domain registrations containing your company name every morning and posts to Slack.
1.  Query `CertStream` (Real-time SSL logs).
2.  Filter for `string == "MyCompany"`.
3.  Post Webhook to Slack.

## 3. Lab: Connecting Systems
*Concept:*
1.  Script A pulls new C2 IPs from Feodo Tracker.
2.  Script A formats them as a Palo Alto EDL (External Dynamic List).
3.  Firewall reads the EDL and blocks them automatically.

---

## 4. Completion Criteria
1.  **Explain** "Rate Limit".
2.  **Describe** the risk of hardcoding API keys in scripts (Cred theft).
