# Shells Explained (Bash, Zsh)

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module configures the program you type into: The Shell. We compare **Bash** (Legacy standard) and **Zsh** (Modern standard in Kali).

### Fit in the Learning Path
You will look at your terminal for thousands of hours. You should know how to customize it, alias commands, and make it work for you.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   Configuration files (`.bashrc` vs `.zshrc`).
*   Creating **Aliases** (Shortcuts).
*   The `$PS1` variable (Prompt String).

## 2. Core Content

### The Interpreters
*   **sh**: The original Bourne Shell. Ancient. Minimal features.
*   **bash** (Bourne Again Shell): The Linux default for 30 years.
*   **zsh** (Z Shell): The new default in Kali/MacOS. Better auto-completion, plugins, and theming.

### Configuration Files (Dotfiles)
When you open a terminal, the shell runs a script to set up your environment.
*   Bash reads: `~/.bashrc`
*   Zsh reads: `~/.zshrc`
*   *Persistence*: If you type a custom setting in the terminal, it dies when you close the window. If you put it in `.zshrc`, it survives.

### Aliases
Shortcuts for long commands.
*   Example: `alias update='sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade'`

## 3. Guided Practice

### Customizing Your Environment
We will create a permanent alias.

**Step 1: Identify your Shell**
```bash
echo $SHELL
```
*   If `/bin/zsh`, edit `~/.zshrc`.
*   If `/bin/bash`, edit `~/.bashrc`.

**Step 2: Add an Alias**
We will use `nano` (a simple text editor).
```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```
Scroll to the bottom. Add this line:
```bash
alias myip='ip a | grep inet'
```
Press `Ctrl+O` (Save), `Enter`, `Ctrl+X` (Exit).

**Step 3: Source (Reload)**
Changes don't apply until you reload the file.
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Step 4: Test**
```bash
myip
```
It should run the complex command.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Reverse Shells**: Why do hackers manually type `/bin/bash -i` when exploiting a system? (To get an interactive prompt).
2.  **History**: Type `history`. Where is this stored? (Hint: `~/.zsh_history`). Why is this a goldmine for attackers?
3.  **Visuals**: How does changing the color of your prompt (Red for Root, Green for User) prevent mistakes?

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You know which shell you are using.
2.  You have created and used a custom alias.
3.  You know where the configuration file lives.
