# Shells Explained (Bash, Zsh)

## Introduction

The **Shell** is the program that takes your command (`ls`) and translates it for the Operating System. It is your environment.

## Common Shells

1.  **sh (Bourne Shell)**: Ancient, simple. Exists on almost every Unix system.
2.  **bash (Bourne Again Shell)**: The standard. Most Linux tutorials assume you are using Bash.
3.  **zsh (Z Shell)**: The modern standard (default in Kali and macOS). It supports themes, plugins, and better auto-completion.

## Customization (.bashrc / .zshrc)

Every time you open a terminal, the shell runs a "startup script".
*   If using Bash: `~/.bashrc`
*   If using Zsh: `~/.zshrc`

You can add **Aliases** here to save time:
```bash
alias update='sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade'
```
Now typing `update` does everything for you.

## Scripting

Shells are also programming languages. You can write "Shell Scripts" (`.sh`) to automate tasks.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, Hacker"
```

## Why This Matters

*   **Reverse Shells**: When you exploit a machine, you are "popping a shell". You are forcing the remote server to give you command line access.
*   **Persistence**: Attackers often hide malicious code in `.bashrc` so it runs every time the victim logs in.
