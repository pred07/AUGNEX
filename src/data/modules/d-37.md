# Hardening AWS/Azure Environments

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers specific defense steps for cloud. **IAM**, **Security Groups**, **MFA**.

### Fit in the Learning Path
The Cloud Management Console is the new Data Center door. Secure it.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **IAM** (Identity is the new perimeter).
*   **Least Privilege** in Cloud.
*   **CloudTrail** (Logging).

---

## 2. Core Content

### IAM (Identity Access Management)
*   **Root Account**: The God Key. Lock it away. Use it once.
*   **Users**: Physical people.
*   **Roles**: Hats that services wear (e.g., EC2 can read S3). Use Roles, not Keys.

### Infrastructure Controls
*   **Security Groups**: The Cloud Firewall. (Stateful).
*   **NACLs**: Network ACLs. (Stateless router filters).

### Visibility
*   **CloudTrail**: Logs every API call. "Who spun up this server?" "Who deleted this bucket?"

## 3. Guided Practice

### Hardening Checklist
1.  **MFA**: Enable on Root AND all Users. (Mandatory).
2.  **Keys**: Rotate Access Keys every 90 days.
3.  **S3**: Block Public Access at the Account Level.
4.  **Ports**: Ensure Security Group for SSH (22) is set to `My IP`, not `0.0.0.0/0`.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Keys in Code**: Why is it bad to hardcode `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` in GitHub? (Scrapers will find it in seconds and mine crypto on your account).
2.  **Roles**: Why use Roles for EC2? (Because they rotate temporary credentials automatically. You never handle long-term keys).
3.  **Alerting**: Alert on "Root Login". It should happen rarely.

---

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You check MFA status first.
2.  You understand the difference between a **Security Group** and a **NACL**.
3.  You verify that CloudTrail is ON.
