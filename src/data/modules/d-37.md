# Evidence Collection and Preservation

## 1. Unit Brief: CSI: Cyber
Forensics is about gathering evidence that stands up in court. If you touch the file, you change the "Last Accessed" timestamp, ruining the evidence.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Employee Theft**: Proving Bob stole the IP requires a perfect Chain of Custody.
*   **Insurance**: Cyber Insurance won't pay if you can't prove how the breach happened.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Chain of Custody
A log of who held the evidence.
*   "Drive collected by Alice at 9AM. Locked in Safe."
*   "Drive removed by Bob at 10AM for imaging."

### Volatility
*   **RAM**: Most volatile. Disappears on power off. Collect FIRST.
*   **Disk**: Persistent. Collect SECOND.

### Forensic Imaging
A bit-for-bit copy (`dd`). Not a file copy. It captures deleted files ("slack space").

## 4. Practical Examples

### Live Response Tool (Velociraptor)
Running a signed script on the live machine to collect:
*   Process List (RAM).
*   Active Connections (RAM).
*   MFT (Master File Table - Disk).
*   Event Logs.

### Hashing
1.  Take Image.
2.  Calculate Hash: `MD5(Image) = abc...`
3.  Give Image to analyst.
4.  Analyst finishes.
5.  Calculate Hash: `MD5(Image) = abc...`. (Matches = Evidence not tampered).

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Analysis on Original**: NEVER analyze the original drive. Make a copy. Analyze the copy.
*   **Modifying timestamps**: Opening a Word doc to read it updates the "Last Opened" time. Use a "Write Blocker".

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Do No Harm**: The investigation should not alter the scene.
*   **Document**: If you didn't write it down, you can't testify to it.
