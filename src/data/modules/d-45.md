# Measuring Defensive Effectiveness

## 1. Unit Brief: Are we winning?
How do you prove to the Board that the $X Million budget is working? "We weren't hacked" is not a metric (it's luck).

## 2. Real-World Relevance
You need metrics to justify budget and show improvement.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Good Metrics
*   **MTTD (Mean Time To Detect)**: How long does the hacker live in the network? (Goal: Lower is better).
*   **MTTR (Mean Time To Respond)**: How fast do we close the ticket?
*   **Coverage**: % of endpoints with EDR installed.
*   **Patch Latency**: Average days to patch critical vulns.

### Bad Metrics
*   **Number of Attacks Blocked**: "We blocked 1 million firewall packets!" (This is noise. The internet is noisy. It means nothing).
*   **Number of Phishing emails**: (You can't control the attackers).

## 4. Practical Examples

### Testing Effectiveness (Purple Teaming)
RED Team attacks. BLUE Team defends. Together they measure.
*   **Attack**: Red Team runs Mimikatz.
*   **Result**: Blue Team saw it after 4 hours.
*   **Action**: Tune detection rule.
*   **Retest**: Blue Team saw it in 15 mins.
*   **Metric**: Improvement from 4hr to 15min.

### Tabletop Exercises
Simulating a crisis (Paper Drill).
*   "Ransomware hit HR."
*   "Who do we call? Does the phone number work?"
*   Finds process gaps.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Vanity Metrics**: Charts that look cool but help make zero decisions.
*   **Static**: Measuring the same thing for 5 years. Threat landscape changes.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Trend > Number**: "MTTD is 4 hours" is just a number. "MTTD went from 24h to 4h" is a success story.
*   **Test**: Don't assume. Validate.
