# Measuring Defensive Effectiveness

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers **Metrics**. How do you know if you are winning?

### Fit in the Learning Path
You bought the tools. You wrote the rules. But are you actually safe?

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)**.
*   **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)**.
*   **Coverage Mapping** (MITRE).

## 2. Core Content

### The Big Two Metrics
1.  **MTTD**: Time from "Breach Start" to "Alert Triggered".
    *   *Goal*: Minutes. (Industry Average: 200 Days).
2.  **MTTR**: Time from "Alert Triggered" to "Attacker Ejected".
    *   *Goal*: Hours.

### Coverage Mapping
Using MITRE ATT&CK.
*   "We have rules for 50% of T1003 (Credential Dumping)."
*   "We have 0% coverage for T1553 (Trust Execution)."
*   *Action*: Prioritize engineering efforts on the gaps.

## 3. Guided Practice

### The Tabletop Exercise using Metrics
**Scenario**: Simulation of Ransomware.

*   Start Time: 09:00.
*   Encryption Successful: 09:15.
*   Alert Fired: 12:00. (MTTD = 3 Hours).
*   Analyst Response: 13:00.
*   Containment: 14:00. (MTTR = 2 hours).

**Verdict**:
*   MTTD of 3 hours is too slow for Ransomware (Encryption took 15 mins).
*   *Conclusion*: We need automated blocking (IPS/EDR), not just alerting.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Vanity Metrics**: Is "Number of Attacks Blocked" a good metric? (No. It just means the firewall is working. It doesn't measure *Risk*).
2.  **Drift**: Does effectiveness decay? (Yes. New attack methods bypass old rules. You must continuously test).
3.  **Purple Team**: This leads into the **Convergence** path. Red Teams test the Blue Team's metrics.

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can calculate **MTTD**.
2.  You stop reporting "Volume" metrics.
3.  You understand that **Testing** is the only way to prove effectiveness.
