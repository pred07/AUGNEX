# Risk-Based Vulnerability Reporting

## 1. Unit Brief: Context is Everything
A CVSS 9.8 vulnerability on a test server with no data is NOT a Critical risk to the business. A CVSS 4.0 vulnerability that leaks the CEO's password IS a Critical risk. You must score based on *Business Risk*, not just technical severity.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Scenario**: SQL Injection found.
*   **Context A**: It's the public marketing site. Database contains public blog posts. **Risk: Medium** (Reputation only).
*   **Context B**: It's the Patient Portal. Database contains logic records. **Risk: Critical** (HIPAA violation, lawsuits).

## 3. Core Concepts

### DREAD Model
*   **D**amage potential
*   **R**eproducibility
*   **E**xploitability
*   **A**ffected Users
*   **D**iscoverability
(Older model, but good for thinking).

### The Risk Matrix
*   **Likelihood**: Rare, Unlikely, Possible, Likely, Certain.
*   **Impact**: Insignificant, Minor, Moderate, Major, Catastrophic.
*   **Risk**: Likelihood x Impact.

## 4. Practical Examples

### Adjusting Severity
*   **Finding**: "SSL Certificate Expired".
*   **Default Tool Score**: Medium.
*   **Context**: It's an internal dev server accessed by 2 people via VPN.
*   **Your Score**: Informational / Low.

### Chained Impact
*   **Finding**: "User Enumeration" (Low).
*   **Context**: Portal has no lockout policy and weak passwords.
*   **Your Score**: Medium/High (Because it leads to imminent account takeover).

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Crying Wolf**: Marking everything as Critical. If everything is critical, nothing is critical.
*   **Ignoring Asset Value**: Hacking the cafeteria menu is legally different from hacking the bank ledger.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Ask the Client**: "What is your most important asset?" Protect that.
*   **Be Realistic**: Don't invent sci-fi scenarios. Stick to provable paths.
