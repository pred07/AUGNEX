# HTTP, HTTPS, and Web Architecture

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module defines the language of the Web. HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the request/response logic that powers 80% of the internet.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Web Application Security (OWASP Top 10) is the largest field in cybersecurity. You cannot secure a website if you don't know what a "Header" or a "Status Code" is.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Client-Server Model**: Request vs Response.
*   **Verbs**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
*   **Status Codes**: 200, 301, 400, 500.

## 2. Core Content

### The Conversation
The web is not magic. It is a text conversation.

**The Client (Browser) says:**
```http
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0...
```

**The Server replies:**
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html

<html>...</html>
```

### Key Components
1.  **URL**: `protocol://domain:port/path?query`.
2.  **Headers**: Metadata. (e.g., `Cookie: session=123`, `Content-Type: application/json`).
3.  **Body**: The actual data (HTML, Image, JSON). GET requests usually have no body.

### Status Codes (The Traffic Lights)
*   **2xx (Success)**: 200 OK.
*   **3xx (Redirection)**: 301 Moved Permanently.
*   **4xx (Client Error)**: 404 Not Found, 403 Forbidden. *You messed up.*
*   **5xx (Server Error)**: 500 Internal Server Error. *The code crashed.*

## 3. Guided Practice

### Inspecting Traffic
We will use the Browser's built-in X-Ray vision.

**Step 1: Open Developer Tools**
*   Right-click anywhere on this page -> **Inspect**.
*   Click the **Network** tab.

**Step 2: Refresh the Page**
*   Press `F5` or Reload.
*   You will see a waterfall of requests.

**Step 3: Analyze the Document**
*   Scroll to the top. Click the first entry (usually the page name).
*   Look at **Headers**.
*   Find **Request Method**: `GET`.
*   Find **Status Code**: `200`.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Privacy**: In HTTP (Cleartext), anyone on your Wi-Fi can read your password. In HTTPS (Encrypted), what can they see? (Only the Domain you are visiting, not the specific page or data).
2.  **Manipulation**: If I intercept a request and change `POST /transfer?amount=10` to `amount=1000`, and the server accepts it, what is that called? (Parameter Tampering).
3.  **Headers**: Why does the User-Agent header exist? (To tell the server if you are on Mobile or Desktop).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You have opened the Network Tab.
2.  You can identify a `200` code and a `404` code.
3.  You understand that a Web Page is constructed from many HTTP requests (HTML, CSS, JS, Images).
