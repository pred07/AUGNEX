# HTTP, HTTPS, and Web Architecture

## Introduction

The Web is the biggest attack surface in the world. To understand it, you must understand the language it speaks: **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**.

## The Request / Response Cycle

The web is stateless. It works like this:
1.  **Client (Browser)**: "GET /index.html"
2.  **Server**: "200 OK. Here is the file."
3.  **Connection Closed**.

The server forgets you immediately after sending the file.

## HTTP Methods

Verbs that tell the server what you want to do:
*   **GET**: Retrieve data (View a page).
*   **POST**: Send data (Login form).
*   **PUT**: Upload/Update data.
*   **DELETE**: Delete data.

## Status Codes

Numbers that tell you what happened:
*   **200 OK**: Success.
*   **301/302 Redirect**: "Go look over there."
*   **400 Bad Request**: "You sent garbage."
*   **401 Unauthorized**: "Login first."
*   **403 Forbidden**: "Login won't help. Get out."
*   **404 Not Found**: "Does not exist."
*   **500 Server Error**: "I crashed."

## HTTPS (Secure)

HTTP is plain text. Anyone on the Wi-Fi can see your password.
**HTTPS** wraps HTTP in **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** encryption.

> We inspect HTTP requests using **Burp Suite** or browser DevTools (F12 -> Network Tab).

## Why This Matters

Web Hacking (SQL Injection, XSS) is simply sending "malicious text" inside these HTTP packets. You are manipulating the conversation.
