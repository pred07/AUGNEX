# MITRE ATT&CK for Purple Teams

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module is the "Periodic Table" of hacking. We use **MITRE ATT&CK** to score our defense.

### Fit in the Learning Path
How do you measure coverage? "We cover 80% of MITRE" is a standard (if ambitious) metric.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Navigator** (The Tool).
*   **Heatmaps**.
*   **TTP Prioritization**.

---

## 2. Core Content

### The Matrix
Columns = Tactics (Goal). e.g., "Persistence".
Rows = Techniques (Method). e.g., "Registry Run Keys".

### Using Navigator
A color-coded map.
*   **Red**: Where we are vulnerable.
*   **Green**: Where we have detections.
*   **Yellow**: Where we have partial visibility.

### Prioritization
You cannot cover all 500+ techniques.
*   Focus on **APT Groups** targeting your sector. (e.g., If you are a Bank, filter for FIN7 techniques).

## 3. Guided Practice

### Creating a Heatmap
1.  Go to MITRE ATT&CK Navigator.
2.  Select "Create New Layer".
3.  Search "APT29" (The group).
4.  View their techniques. (These are the ones you MUST Detect).
5.  Assess your rules. Do you have a rule for `T1003`? Yes -> Color Green.

---

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Sub-Techniques**: T1003 is huge. `T1003.001` is "LSASS Dump". `T1003.002` is "SAM Dump". You need granularity.
2.  **False Confidence**: Green doesn't mean "Blocked". It means "We have a rule". The rule might suck. Test it.
3.  **Maintenance**: MITRE updates constantly. Keep up.

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You have used **MITRE Navigator**.
2.  You understand that not all squares are equal.
3.  You use the Matrix to communicate gaps to management.
