# MITRE ATT&CK for Purple Teams

## 1. What this module covers
Using MITRE ATT&CK specifically for planning Purple Team exercises and tracking progress.

## 2. Why this matters for purple teams
Defenders use ATT&CK to categorize. Purple Teams use ATT&CK to *plan simulation*.

## 3. Core concepts explained clearly

### Threat Informed Defense
Don't test everything. Test what matters.
*   **Industry**: Finance.
*   **Threat Actors**: APT38 (Lazarus), FIN7.
*   **Plan**: Test the techniques *they* use (e.g., SWIFT Abuse, Spearphishing).

### The Navigator Layer
*   Create a layer: "Current Validated Detection".
*   Mark known detected techniques in Green.
*   The uncolored cells become your roadmap for the next Purple Team exercise.

## 4. Validation examples

### Planning an Exercise
*   **Theme**: Ransomware Simulation.
*   **Techniques Selected**:
    *   T1486 (Data Encrypted for Impact).
    *   T1490 (Inhibit System Recovery - delete shadows).
    *   T1047 (WMI - lateral movement).
*   **Execution**: Run these 3 specific tests.
*   **Report**: "We detected the Encryption, but missed the Shadow Copy deletion."

## 5. Common gaps and failures
*   **Coverage vs Depth**: "We cover T1059 (PowerShell)". Do you cover *all* variations? Or just `powershell.exe`? What about `PowerShell_ISE.exe`? What about Unmanaged PowerShell? Don't claim Green too easily.

## 6. Key takeaways
*   **Language**: ATT&CK is the Rosetta Stone between Red and Blue.
*   **Roadmap**: Use it to prioritize your engineering backlog.
