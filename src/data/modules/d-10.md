# Linux Logging Fundamentals

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers **Syslog**. The text-based standard of the Unix world.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Linux powers the cloud and the internet backbone. If you can't grep logs, you can't debug the server.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   `/var/log/syslog` (or `messages`).
*   `/var/log/auth.log` (or `secure`).
*   **Journald**: The modern systemd logger.

## 2. Core Content

### Flat Files
Linux logs are text.
*   **Location**: `/var/log`.
*   **Format**: `Date Host Service: Message`.

### Key Files
1.  **Auth.log** (Debian) / **Secure** (RHEL): Login attempts (SSH, Sudo).
2.  **Syslog**: General messages.
3.  **Apache2/Access.log**: Web traffic.

### Journald (Binary Logs)
Modern Linux uses `systemd-journald`. It stores logs in binary format for speed, but you view them with `journalctl`.
*   Effect: You can't just `cat` them. You must use the tool.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Grep-ing for Evil
**Scenario**: Find failed SSH attempts.

**Command**:
```bash
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log
```
**Results**:
`Mar 10 12:00:00 server sshd[99]: Failed password for invalid user admin from 192.168.1.50`

**Command**: Trace a user's sudo usage.
```bash
grep "COMMAND" /var/log/auth.log
```

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Immutability**: Can Root edit log files? (Yes. `nano /var/log/auth.log`. This is why we need Remote Logging).
2.  **Rotation**: What is `logrotate`? (A tool that zips old logs (auth.log.1.gz) so the disk doesn't fill up).
3.  **Format**: Why is Parsing Linux logs hard? (Because every application creates its own weird text format).

---

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can find `/var/log`.
2.  You know which file holds SSH logs (`auth.log` or `secure`).
3.  You appreciate the simplicity (and fragility) of text logs.
