# Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
"Trust but Verify" is dead. Zero Trust means "Never Trust, Always Verify." It moves the perimeter from the Network to the **Identity**. This module covers **BeyondCorp**, **Micro-segmentation**, and **Continuous Auth**.

### Learning Objectives
*   Define the 3 Pillars: **Identity**, **Device Health**, **Policy**.
*   Implement **Identity Aware Proxy (IAP)**.
*   Move away from VPNs.

## 2. Core Content

### The Old Model (Castle & Moat)
Once you VPN in, you can touch everything. Malware on your laptop spreads laterally.

### The Zero Trust Model
Every request is authenticated and authorized.

**The Decision Engine:**
User Alice wants to access App B.
1.  **Who is she?** (MFA ok?).
2.  **What device?** (Corporate Laptop? Patched? EDR running?).
3.  **Where is she?** (Geo-IP ok?).
4.  **Policy:** Alice is allowed to see App B.
**Result:** Proxy grants access for *this request only*.

### Micro-segmentation
Stopping lateral movement. Server A cannot talk to Server B unless explicitly allowed by policy (mTLS), even if they are on the same subnet.

## 3. Lab: Conditional Access

### Scenario
Configure a Conditional Access Policy (Azure AD / Okta).

1.  **Target:** Engineering Wiki.
2.  **Condition 1:** User Group = Engineers.
3.  **Condition 2:** Device State = Compliant (Intune registered + BitLocker on).
4.  **Grant:** Access.
5.  **Test:** Try accessing from personal phone.
    *   *Result:* Blocked. "Device not managed."

## 4. Reflection
1.  Why causes "MFA Fatigue"? (Spamming the user with push notifications until they click "Approve" just to make it stop. Zero Trust adds context to prevent this necessity).
2.  Is Zero Trust a product? (No. It's a strategy. You can't "Buy Zero Trust". You build it using IAM, EDR, and Proxies).
