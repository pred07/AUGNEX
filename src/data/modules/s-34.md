# Data Enrichment & Correlation

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
Raw data is useless. "1.2.3.4" means nothing. "1.2.3.4 (Russia, VPN Node, Seen in APT29 campaign)" is Intelligence. This is Enrichment.

### Learning Objectives
*   Enrich IPs (Geo, ASN, Reputation).
*   Enrich Domains (Whois, Age, Entropy).
*   Enrich Files (Signatures, Metadata).

---

## 2. Core Content

### Enrichment Sources
1.  **Geo/ASN:** MaxMind, IPInfo. (Where is it?)
2.  **Reputation:** GreyNoise. (Is it scanning everyone or just me?)
    *   *GreyNoise:* "If everyone sees it, it's noise. If only I see it, it's targeted."
3.  **Passive DNS:** RiskIQ/PassiveTotal. (What did this IP resolve to yesterday?)

### Correlation Logic
*   **Event A:** Firewall block from IP X.
*   **Event B:** 1 hour later, Failed Login from IP X.
*   **Event C:** 1 hour later, User Y logs in from IP X.
*   **Correlation:** Account Compromise. (Brute force -> Success).

## 3. Lab: The Context King
**Input:** IP `45.33.2.1`.
**Enrichment:**
*   Geo: USA.
*   Host: Linode (VPS).
*   Ports: 22, 80, 443, 8080.
*   GreyNoise: "RIOT" (Benign scanner? No). "Unknown".
*   Passive DNS: `c2-update.com`.
**Verdict:** Malicious C2.

## 4. Completion Criteria
1.  **Define** "Enrichment".
2.  **Explain** how GreyNoise helps filter false positives.
