# The Dark Web & Tor (Introduction)

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module provides the technical foundation for Dark Web research (before the operational module s-36). It explains **Onion Routing**, **Bridges**, and the difference between Deep Web and Dark Web.

### Learning Objectives
*   Explain the 3-hop architecture of Tor.
*   Differentiate Surface vs Deep vs Dark Web.
*   Install and configure the **Tor Browser** safely.

## 2. Core Content

### Definitions
*   **Surface Web:** Indexed by Google (BBC, Wikipedia).
*   **Deep Web:** Not indexed. Requires login (Gmail, Banking, Corporate Intranets). 90% of the web.
*   **Dark Web:** Requires specific software (Tor/I2P) and is encrypted/anonymized.

### How Tor Works (The Onion)
Data is wrapped in 3 layers of encryption.
1.  **Guard Node:** Peels layer 1. Knows IP.
2.  **Middle Node:** Peels layer 2. Knows nothing.
3.  **Exit Node:** Peels layer 3. Sends data to destination.

### Staying Safe
*   **No Scripts:** Disable JavaScript (Security Level: Safest).
*   **Window Size:** Do not resize the window (prevents fingerprinting resolution).
*   **Identity:** Do not log into personal accounts (Facebook/Gmail) over Tor.

## 3. Lab: Connection Check

### Task
1.  **Download:** Tor Browser (from `torproject.org` ONLY).
2.  **Connect:** Open browser.
3.  **Verify:** Visit `check.torproject.org`. It should say "Congratulations. This browser is configured to use Tor."
4.  **Explore:** Visit a Directory like `tor.taxi` (a link aggregator).

## 4. Reflection
1.  Can the ISP see you are using Tor? (Yes. They see encrypted traffic to a Tor Guard Node. They can't see *what* you are doing, but they know *that* you are doing it).
2.  What is a "Tor Bridge"? (A secret entry node used to bypass censorship if the main Guard Nodes are blocked).
