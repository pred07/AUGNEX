# Antivirus vs EDR

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module contrasts **Legacy AV** (Signature) with **EDR** (Endpoint Detection and Response).

### Fit in the Learning Path
"My antivirus didn't catch it" is a common phrase. You need to know why, and what replaces it.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **AV**: File scanning.
*   **EDR**: Behavior recording.
*   **XDR**: Correlation across Endpoint + Network + Cloud.

## 2. Core Content

### Antivirus (Legacy)
*   **Mechanism**: Scans files on disk. "Is this hash known bad?"
*   **limitation**: In-memory attacks (Fileless Malware) bypass it completely.

### EDR (The Flight Recorder)
*   **Mechanism**: Records *activity*. "Process A opened Connection B".
*   **Value**: It doesn't just block; it tells you *what happened*.
    *   "PowerShell ran encoded command."
    *   "Outlook spawned cmd.exe."
*   **Response**: Can "Isolate Host" remotely.

## 3. Guided Practice

### The Evasion Test
**Attack**:
1.  Attacker writes a malicious script in PowerShell.
2.  Attacker runs it *directly into memory* (Reflective Injection). It never touches the hard drive.

**AV Reaction**:
Nothing. No file was created.

**EDR Reaction**:
Alert: "Suspicious PowerShell Memory Allocation". "bypassing execution policy".

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Cost**: Why is EDR expensive? (It stores massive amounts of telemetry data in the cloud).
2.  **Manual**: Does EDR block everything automatically? (No. It generates alerts that Analysts must investigate. It requires adequate staffing).
3.  **Privacy**: Does EDR see my private files? (Technically yes. It sees every file opened. Trust is key).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can explain why AV fails against modern threats.
2.  You treat EDR as a **Sensor**, not just a Shield.
3.  You know the term **Fileless Malware**.
