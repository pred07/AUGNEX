# Types of Logs (System, Application, Security)

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module categorizes the noise. We break down **System**, **Application**, and **Security** logs.

### Fit in the Learning Path
You need to know where to look. If Apache crashes, checking the Windows Event Log won't help.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **System Logs**: Kernel/OS health.
*   **Security Logs**: Auth/Access.
*   **App Logs**: Software specific logic.

## 2. Core Content

### 1. System Logs
"The Engine Room".
*   **Content**: Driver loads, Hardware errors, Service starts/stops.
*   **Value**: Detects "Persistence" (Installing a new service).

### 2. Security Logs
"The Bouncer".
*   **Content**: Login Success/Failure, File Access (Permission Denied).
*   **Value**: Detects Brute Force, Unauthorized access.

### 3. Application Logs
"The User Activity".
*   **Content**: "User added item to cart", "Database query failed".
*   **Value**: Detects Business Logic abuse or SQL Injection errors.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Log Hunting
Where would you find evidence for these events?

**Event A**: A user tried to guess a password 50 times.
*   **Source**: Security Log (Auth Failure).

**Event B**: A USB drive was plugged in.
*   **Source**: System Log (Hardware event).

**Event C**: A SQL Injection triggered a syntax error.
*   **Source**: Application Log (Database Error).

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Format**: Why is JSON better than text for logs? (Machines can parse JSON easily. Text requires regex).
2.  **Consistency**: Why do developers struggle with logging? (They often log meaningless things like "Error: it broke" instead of "Error: DB Connection Timeout").
3.  **Aggregation**: How do you read all three at once? (SIEM. It collects and merges them).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can map an event to its Log Type.
2.  You understand that Security Logs are usually the loudest and most critical for us.
3.  You appreciate the need for structured logging.
