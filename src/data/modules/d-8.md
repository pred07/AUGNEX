# Types of Logs (System, Application, Security)

## 1. Unit Brief: The flavors of Data
Not all logs are equal. A System log tells you "The disk is full". A Security log tells you "Someone deleted the audit trail". Knowing the difference helps you look in the right place.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **App Crash**: Check Access/Error logs.
*   **Slow Network**: Check Firewall/Router logs.
*   **Hacking Attempt**: Check Auth/Security logs.

## 3. Core Concepts

### System Logs
Operating System health.
*   Kernel messages, Driver failures, Startup/Shutdown events.
*   *Linux*: `/var/log/syslog`, `dmesg`.
*   *Windows*: System Event Log.

### Application Logs
Generated by software (IIS, Apache, MySQL, Custom Apps).
*   "User updated profile", "Database connection failed".
*   These are crucial for Business Logic attacks.

### Security Logs
Specific events related to access.
*   Logins (Success/Fail).
*   Privilege Escalation (Sudo usage).
*   Process Creation.
*   *Windows*: Security Event Log (Audit).

## 4. Practical Examples

### Apache Logs
`/var/log/apache2/access.log`
`10.0.0.1 - - [12/Dec/2023] "GET /admin.php HTTP/1.1" 403 500`
*   **Interpretation**: Someone tried to access admin.php and was denied (403).

### Windows Security Event 4624
`Event ID 4624: An account was successfully logged on.`
*   Contains: Logon Type (Network vs Interactive), Source IP, Username.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Ignoring Application Logs**: Security tools often miss app-layer attacks (like SQLi). Only the App Log shows the weird SQL syntax error.
*   **Permissions**: Developers often make log files world-readable (`chmod 777`). Logs contain sensitive info!

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Context**: You need to correlate all three.
*   *Example*: App Log says "File Uploaded". System Log says "New Process Spawned". Security Log says "Account Added". -> RCE confirmed.
