# What Makes a Good Detection

## 1. What this module covers
The qualities of a high-fidelity alert. Why some alerts get fixed and others get ignored.

## 2. Why this matters for purple teams
If you flood the SOC with bad detections, you create "Alert Fatigue". A good detection is Precise, Actionable, and Durable.

## 3. Core concepts explained clearly

### The Pyramid of Pain
*   **Hash/IP**: Easy to detect, Easy for attacker to change. (Low value).
*   **TTP (Behavior)**: Hard to detect, Hard for attacker to change. (High value).
*   *Goal*: Write detections at the TTP level.

### Attributes of Quality
1.  **Precision**: Low False Positives.
2.  **Recall**: Low False Negatives (Catches the variations).
3.  **Context**: Includes User, Host, and Parent Process.

## 4. Validation examples

### Bad vs Good Rule
*   **Bad**: "Alert on `mimikatz.exe`".
    *   *Result*: Attacker renames it. Rule fails. (Brittle).
*   **Good**: "Alert on Process Accessing `lsass.exe` with specific access mask".
    *   *Result*: Attacker renames tool. Rule still fires. (Durable).

## 5. Common gaps and failures
*   **Broad Regex**: `CommandLine="*password*"` -> Alerts on every "Change Password" event. SOC ignores it.
*   **Documentation**: The alert name is "Rule 1005". Analyst has no idea what that means. Name it: "T1003 - LSASS Access Detected".

## 6. Key takeaways
*   **Durability**: Ask "If the attacker changes the file name, does this still work?"
*   **Actionability**: Ask "If this fires, does the analyst know exactly what to do?"
