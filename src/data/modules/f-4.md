# Installing Kali Linux Safely

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module guides you through the installation of **Kali Linux**, the industry-standard distribution for offensive security, as a Virtual Machine.

### Fit in the Learning Path
You have a Hypervisor (from the previous module). Now you need an Operating System to run your tools. Kali is your primary "Attack Platform."

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   How to download and verify the Kali Linux ISO.
*   How to configure a VM for optimal performance (RAM/CPU allocation).
*   The difference between "Live Mode" and "Installed Mode."

## 2. Core Content

### What is Kali Linux?
Kali is a Debian-based Linux distribution maintained by Offensive Security.
*   **Pre-loaded**: It comes with 600+ security tools (Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite) pre-installed.
*   **Kernel Patched**: The kernel is modified for packet injection (Wi-Fi hacking).
*   **Rolling Release**: It updates constantly.

### The Installation Strategy
We will install Kali as a **Guest VM**.
*   **Safety**: If you download malware during analysis, it stays in the VM.
*   **Portability**: You can move the `.vdi` or `.vmdk` file to another computer.

### System Requirements
*   **RAM**: Minimum 2GB (4GB Recommended).
*   **Disk**: Minimum 20GB (40GB Recommended).
*   **CPU**: 2 Cores.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Step 1: Download the ISO
1.  Go to [kali.org/get-kali](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/).
2.  Select **Installer Images**.
3.  Download the **64-bit** Installer.

### Step 2: Create the VM (VirtualBox Example)
1.  Open VirtualBox -> **New**.
2.  **Name**: "Kali-Linux-2025".
3.  **Type**: Linux. **Version**: Debian (64-bit).
4.  **RAM**: 4096 MB (4GB).
5.  **Disk**: Create a Virtual Hard Disk -> VDI -> Dynamically Allocated -> 40GB.

### Step 3: Boot and Install
1.  Select the new VM -> **Settings** -> **Storage**.
2.  Click the **Empty** CD icon -> Click the Blue Disc icon -> **Choose a disk file**.
3.  Select your downloaded Kali `.iso`.
4.  Click **Start**.
5.  Select **Graphical Install**.
6.  Default options are safe. When asked about "Partition Disks", select **Guided - use entire disk**. (Don't worry, this only erases the *Virtual Disk*, not your physical hard drive).
7.  **Software Selection**: Keep "Top 10 tools" and "Default" selected.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Trust**: Why should you verify the SHA256 checksum of the ISO before installing?
2.  **Identity**: By default, Kali used to run as `root`. Now it runs as `kali` (standard user). Why did they make this change?
3.  **Risk**: If you bridge your network adapter, is your Kali VM accessible from the internet?

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You have a running Kali Linux VM.
2.  You can log in (default user: `kali`, password: `kali`).
3.  You can open a terminal inside the VM.
