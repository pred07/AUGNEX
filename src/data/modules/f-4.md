# Installing Kali Linux Safely

## Introduction

Kali Linux is the industry standard for penetration testing. It comes pre-loaded with thousands of security tools. We will install it as a **Virtual Machine** (VM). This is the safest and most flexible way to use it.

## Preparation

Before we start, ensure you have:
1.  **VirtualBox** or **VMware Player** installed (from Module f-3).
2.  At least **20GB** free disk space.
3.  At least **4GB** RAM available for the VM.

## Step 1: Download the ISO

1.  Go to `kali.org/get-kali`.
2.  Select **"Installer Images"** (Recommended).
3.  Download the **64-bit** Installer ISO.
    *   *Note*: Do not download the "Virtual Machines" pre-built image for this lesson. We want to learn the installation process.

## Step 2: Configure the VM

1.  Open VirtualBox/VMware.
2.  Click **New**.
3.  **Name**: `Kali-Linux-Lab`.
4.  **Type**: Linux.
5.  **Version**: Debian (64-bit).
6.  **RAM**: 4096 MB (4GB) or more.
7.  **Disk**: Create a virtual hard disk (VDI), Dynamically Allocated, **25GB** size.

## Step 3: Installation

1.  Start the VM. It will ask for a startup disk. Select the **Kali .iso** file you downloaded.
2.  Select **Graphical Install**.
3.  **Language/Region**: Choose your preference.
4.  **Hostname**: `kali`.
5.  **Domain**: Leave blank.
6.  **User**: Create a user (e.g., `student`). **Password**: Choose a strong one (e.g., `toor` for labs).
7.  **Partitioning**: Select "Guided - use entire disk". This refers to the *virtual* disk, not your real one. Safe to proceed.
8.  **Software Selection**: Keep the defaults (Desktop Environment + Standard Tools). This part takes time.

## Post-Install

Once finished, the VM will reboot. Log in with your new user.

> **Command Time**: Open a terminal (black icon at top) and run:
> ```bash
> hostnamectl
> ```
> This verifies your system name and OS version.

## Why This Matters

You just built your own hacking computer inside your regular computer. You can break it, infect it, or delete it without harming your real life.
