# IDS vs IPS Explained

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers **Intrusion Detection (IDS)** and **Intrusion Prevention (IPS)**. The alarm and the trap.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Firewalls block *ports*. IDS/IPS blocks *attacks* (inside the allowed ports).

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **IDS (Passive)**: Tap mode.
*   **IPS (Inline)**: Filter mode.
*   **False Positive Risk**.

## 2. Core Content

### IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
A camera observing the traffic.
*   **Position**: Connected to a SPAN port (Mirror).
*   **Action**: Alerts the Analyst. Does NOT stop the packet.
*   **Risk**: Zero impact on network latency.

### IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)
A gatekeeper standing in the wire.
*   **Position**: Inline (Cable goes In -> IPS -> Out).
*   **Action**: Drops the packet if malicious.
*   **Risk**: If the IPS crashes or blocks valid traffic (False Positive), it breaks the business.

## 3. Guided Practice

### The "SQL Injection" Packet
Packet: `GET /?id=' OR 1=1`

**Scenario A: Firewall**
*   Port 80 is allowed. Firewall lets it through.

**Scenario B: IDS**
*   Sees the pattern `' OR 1=1`.
*   Sends email to Admin: "Possible SQLi detected".
*   *Outcome*: Attack succeeds, but we know about it.

**Scenario C: IPS**
*   Sees the pattern.
*   sends TCP RST (Reset) to the attacker.
*   *Outcome*: Attack failed.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Tuning**: Why do most companies run IPS in "Detection Mode" (IDS) first? (To learn the baseline and avoid blocking legitimate traffic by mistake).
2.  **Encryption**: Can IDS see inside HTTPS? (No. Not unless you perform SSL Decryption/Termination before the IDS).
3.  **Evasion**: Can an attacker fragment packets to bypass IDS? (Yes. Fragmentation attacks try to split the signature across two packets).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can distinguish between Passive (IDS) and Inline (IPS).
2.  You understand why Finance companies are scared of IPS blocking trades.
3.  You know that IDS requires a "SPAN Port" or "Tap".
