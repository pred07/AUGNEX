# IDS vs IPS Explained

## 1. Unit Brief: Burglar Alarms vs Guard Dogs
*   **IDS (Intrusion Detection System)**: Sees the burglar, triggers an alarm. (Passive).
*   **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)**: Sees the burglar, bites him, and locks the door. (Active).

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **IDS Mode**: Good for "Tuning". You don't want to block legitimate traffic by mistake.
*   **IPS Mode**: Good for "Known Bad". Block "WannaCry Ransomware" instantly.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Placement
*   **NIDS (Network)**: Sits on the switch (SPAN port). Sees all traffic.
*   **HIDS (Host)**: Sits on the server (OSSEC/Wazuh). Sees encrypted traffic (after decryption).

### Signature vs Anomaly
*   **Signature**: "Packet contains `cmd.exe`". Match!
*   **Anomaly**: "Web server is speaking Protocol X on Port 80". Alert!

## 4. Practical Examples

### Snort / Suricata Rule
```
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HTTP_SERVERS 80 (msg:"Possible SQL Injection"; content:"UNION SELECT"; sid:100001;)
```
*   **Interpretation**: If any packet to Port 80 contains the text "UNION SELECT", scream "SQL Injection".

### False Positives
*   A user is reading a tutorial about SQL Injection. The packet contains "UNION SELECT".
*   **IDS**: Alerts.
*   **Analyst**: Must investigate context. "Oh, it's just a blog post."

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Turning on IPS too early**: If you enable IPS on Day 1, you will block the CEO's email and get fired. Run in IDS mode for weeks first to tune the rules.
*   **Encryption**: Network IDS cannot read HTTPS. You effectively see nothing. You need SSL Decryption or HIDS.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Visibility**: IDS gives you deep insight into *content*, not just headers (Firewall).
*   **Tuning**: An IDS is high maintenance. It needs constant care.
