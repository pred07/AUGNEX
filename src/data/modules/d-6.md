# Threats, Adversaries, and Attack Lifecycle

## 1. Unit Brief: Know Your Enemy
Defenders don't fight "Malware". They fight Humans using malware. Understanding who is attacking you and how they work (TTPs) allows you to predict their next move.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Script Kiddie**: Noise. Block IP. Done.
*   **APT (State Actor)**: Low and slow. If you block their IP, they will switch infrastructure and wait 3 months. You need a different strategy.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Types of Adversaries
*   **Cyber Criminals**: Motivation = Money (Ransomware).
*   **Hacktivists**: Motivation = Ideology (Defacement/DDoS).
*   **Nation States (APT)**: Motivation = Espionage/Destruction.
*   **Insiders**: Motivation = Revenge/Greed.

### The Cyber Kill Chain (Lockheed Martin)
1.  **Recon**: Research.
2.  **Weaponization**: Building the PDF exploit.
3.  **Delivery**: Emailing the PDF.
4.  **Exploitation**: PDF runs code.
5.  **Installation**: Malware installs backdoor.
6.  **C2**: Malware phones home.
7.  **Actions on Objectives**: Stealing data.

*   **Defense**: Break the chain anywhere, and the attack fails.

## 4. Practical Examples

### Breaking the Chain
*   **Recon**: You can't stop it (Public info).
*   **Delivery**: Email Filter blocks the PDF. (**Success**).
*   **Exploitation**: Patching Acrobat Reader prevents code execution. (**Success**).
*   **C2**: Firewall blocks traffic to Russia. (**Success**).

### MITRE ATT&CK
The modern map of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures).
*   Instead of "Kill Chain", it lists 200+ specific techniques like "T1003 OS Credential Dumping".

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Focusing only on Malware**: Deleting the virus file is useless if the Hacker still looks like a legitimate Admin user. You have to evict the *Adversary*, not just the tool.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Intelligence Driven Defense**: Don't defend against "everything". Defend against the groups targeting your sector.
