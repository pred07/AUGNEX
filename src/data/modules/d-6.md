# Threats, Adversaries, and Attack Lifecycle

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module maps the enemy's movement. We use the **Cyber Kill Chain** and **MITRE ATT&CK** framework to predict what happens next.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Defense is not random. If you see "Reconnaissance", you know "Weaponization" is next. If you see "Lateral Movement", you know "Exfiltration" is coming.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   The **Cyber Kill Chain** (7 Steps).
*   **MITRE ATT&CK** (The Matrix of Tactics).
*   **Pyramid of Pain** (What hurts the attacker).

## 2. Core Content

### The Cyber Kill Chain (Lockheed Martin)
1.  **Recon**: Research.
2.  **Weaponization**: Building the payload.
3.  **Delivery**: Email/USB/Web.
4.  **Exploitation**: Code runs.
5.  **Installation**: Persistence/Backdoor.
6.  **C2 (Command & Control)**: Phone home.
7.  **Actions on Objectives**: Steal data / Encrypt data.

**Goal**: Break the chain as early as possible.

### MITRE ATT&CK
A massive knowledge base of *real* adversary behaviors.
*   Instead of "Recon", it says "T1595 - Active Scanning".
*   It serves as the definitive language for TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures).

## 3. Guided Practice

### Mapping an Attack
**Story**:
"User clicked a PDF invoice (1). It installed a hidden task (2). The computer started talking to a Russian IP (3)."

**Kill Chain Mapping**:
1.  **Delivery**: Phishing Email.
2.  **Installation**: Persistence (Scheduled Task).
3.  **C2**: Network traffic.

**MITRE Mapping**:
1.  **T1566**: Phishing.
2.  **T1053**: Scheduled Task/Job.
3.  **T1071**: Application Layer Protocol.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Resilience**: If you catch them at Step 6 (C2), is it too late? (Not always. They might not have stolen data yet. But it's close).
2.  **Pyramid of Pain**: What is harder for an attacker to change: Their IP address or their TTPs (Behavior)? (TTPs. IPs are cheap. Learning a new hacking technique is hard).
3.  **Value**: Why do we map attacks? (To share intelligence. "Group X uses T1053" helps everyone look for T1053).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can recite the 7 steps of the Kill Chain.
2.  You have browsed the MITRE ATT&CK web page.
3.  You understand that defense is about **Breaking the Chain**.
