# Network Segmentation and Zones

## 1. Unit Brief: Bulkheads of the Ship
The Titanic sank because the water spilled over the bulkheads. Network segmentation stops the hacker from spilling over from the "Guest Wifi" to the "Corporate Database".

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Target Breach (2013)**: Hackers compromised the HVAC contractor. The HVAC network could talk to the Payment Network. 40 million credit cards stolen.
*   **Solution**: Segmentation. HVAC should never talk to Payments.

## 3. Core Concepts

### DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)
The "No Man's Land" between the internet and your internal network.
*   **Web Servers** live here.
*   Internet can talk to DMZ.
*   DMZ cannot talk to Internal (mostly).

### VLANs (Virtual LANs)
Logical separation on switches.
*   **VLAN 10**: HR.
*   **VLAN 20**: Engineering.
*   **VLAN 30**: Guest.
*   **VLAN 666**: Malware Lab.

### Micro-Segmentation
Every server is its own island. Server A cannot talk to Server B unless explicitly allowed. (Zero Trust).

## 4. Practical Examples

### The Three-Tier Architecture
1.  **Web Tier (DMZ)**: Exposed to internet.
2.  **App Tier (Internal)**: Only Web Tier can talk to it.
3.  **Data Tier (Secure)**: Only App Tier can talk to it.
*   **Attack**: Hacker owns Web Tier. They cannot reach the Database directly. They have to hack the App Tier first. (Harder).

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Flat Networks**: "It's easier to manage if everyone can ping everyone." (Security Nightmare).
*   **VLAN Hopping**: Thinking VLANs are magic security boundaries. If the switch is misconfigured, you can hop VLANs. You need Firewalls *between* VLANs.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Containment**: Segmentation limits the Blast Radius of a breach.
*   **Least Privilege**: Only open paths that are absolutely necessary.
