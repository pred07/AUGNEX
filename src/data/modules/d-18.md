# Network Segmentation and Zones

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers **Segmentation**. Splitting the network into airtight compartments. **VLANs**, **DMZs**, and **Micro-segmentation**.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Flat networks (where everyone talks to everyone) are a hacker's dream. Segmentation stops "Lateral Movement".

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **VLANs**: Virtual LANs.
*   **DMZ**: Demilitarized Zone.
*   The "Pivot" problem.

## 2. Core Content

### The Zones
1.  **Untrusted**: The Internet.
2.  **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)**: Exposed services (Web, Mail). Can talk to Internet. Cannot talk to Internal freely.
3.  **User LAN**: Employees. Can talk to Internet (via Proxy). Cannot talk to Data Center freely.
4.  **Data Center / Restricted**: Databases. NO internet access. Only accessible from specific App Servers in DMZ.

### Micro-Segmentation
Taking it further. `Server A` cannot talk to `Server B` even if they are in the same room, unless explicitly allowed. (Zero Trust).

## 3. Guided Practice

### The Contagion Model
Imagine Malware is a virus (biological).
*   **Flat Network**: Everyone is in one crowded stadium. One sneeze infects everyone.
*   **Segmented Network**: Everyone is in separate quarantine rooms (VLANs). The virus traps itself in one room.

**Attack Path**:
Attacker hacks Web Server (DMZ).
*   *Attempts to RDP to Database*.
*   *Firewall says*: DMZ VLAN cannot connect to DB VLAN on port 3389. Blocked.
*   *Lateral Movement Failed*.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **VLAN Hopping**: Is a VLAN a security boundary? (Weakly. It's meant for broadcast control. You need an ACL/Firewall routing *between* VLANs to make it a security boundary).
2.  **Management**: Why is segmentation hard? (It breaks things. "Why can't I print?" "Because the Printer is in the Printer VLAN and you didn't open port 9100").
3.  **Printers**: Why put Printers in their own VLAN? (They are notoriously insecure and unpatched).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can draw a DMZ architecture.
2.  You understand that Segmentation contains the blast radius of a breach.
3.  You advocate for putting IoT devices on a "Guest Network".
