# Investigating Suspicious Processes

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module is the "Hand-to-Hand Combat" of defense. You found a process. It looks bad. Now what?

### Fit in the Learning Path
Triage determines the outcome. If you kill the process, you might lose the evidence (RAM). If you leave it, it might encrypt the disk.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Memory vs Disk** investigation.
*   **Strings** analysis.
*   **Network Connections**.

## 2. Core Content

### Live Response
1.  **Network**: What is it talking to? (`netstat`).
2.  **Files**: What files does it have open?
3.  **Memory**: Dump the RAM (for forensics).

### Strings
Binaries contain text. URLs, Error messages, IP addresses.
*   Running `strings evil.exe` often reveals the C2 IP address.

### VirusTotal
The Google of Malware. Upload the hash (not the file, for privacy) to see if 60 other antiviruses recognize it.

## 3. Guided Practice

### The Process Hacker (Tool)
(Or Task Manager).

**Step 1**: Find Process.
**Step 2**: Check **Network** tab.
*   Connecting to `8.8.8.8`? (Normal DNS).
*   Connecting to `45.x.x.x`? (Suspicious).
**Step 3**: Check **Handles**.
*   Does it have a lock on `passwords.txt`?
**Step 4**: Decision.
*   **Suspend** (Pause it).
*   **Dump** (Save memory).
*   **Kill**.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Privacy**: Why upload only the Hash to VirusTotal? (If you upload a document containing valid passwords, everyone including hackers can download it from VirusTotal).
2.  **Encryption**: If the malware is encrypted? (You won't see strings on disk. But in Memory (RAM), it must decrpyt itself to run. Dump memory to see it).
3.  **Obfuscation**: What is packed malware? (Compressed code that unpacks itself in memory to evade AV).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You know how to use `strings`.
2.  You check Network Connections before killing the process.
3.  You value **RAM Dumps** over Disk Dumps for active threats.
