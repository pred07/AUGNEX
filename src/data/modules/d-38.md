# Communication During Incidents

## 1. Unit Brief: Controlling the Narrative
An incident is a crisis. Rumors spread. Customers panic. Clear communication saves the reputation.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Bad**: "We might have been hacked. We aren't sure. Maybe." (Stock price crashes).
*   **Good**: "We identified unauthorized access. We have contained it. No customer data was impacted. Investigation ongoing." (Confidence).

## 3. Core Concepts

### Out-of-Band (OOB) Communication
*   If the hacker is in your email server, you cannot email "How do we stop him?" to your team. He will read it.
*   Use Signal, WhatsApp, or personal phones.

### Stakeholders
*   **Technical Team**: Needs details (IPs, hashes).
*   **Legal**: Needs liability assessment.
*   **PR**: Needs public statement.
*   **C-Suite**: Needs status and cost.

## 4. Practical Examples

### The Status Update
Format:
1.  **Current Status**: Contained? Spreading?
2.  **Impact**: What systems are down?
3.  **Actions Taken**: What have we done?
4.  **Next Steps**: What are we doing next?
5.  **ETA**: When is the next update?

### The "War Room"
A physical or virtual room where decision makers gather.
*   Leader: Incident Commander. (Not necessarily the CEO. usually the CISO or IR Lead).

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Speculation**: "I think it's Russia." Don't guess. Stick to facts. "We see IPs geo-located in Russia." (Different).
*   **Silence**: Going dark for 24 hours scares everyone. Send updates even if it is "No change".

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **One Voice**: Only the designated spokesperson talks to the press.
*   **Transparency**: Lying about a breach (Uber) is illegal and destroys trust.
