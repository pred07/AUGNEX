## 2. Core Content

### The Parallels
*   **CISO**: Manages existential risk. Balances budget. Leads through crisis.
*   **CEO**: Manages market risk. Balances P&L. Leads the company.

### The Gap
*   **Sales/Product**: CISOs often lack experience in *making* money (Revenue gen).
*   *Advice*: Take a rotation in Product Management. Learn how the sausage is sold.

## 3. Guided Practice

### The Business Pitch
**Activity**: Don't pitch a security tool. Pitch a new product line enabled by security.

*   This is CEO thinking.
