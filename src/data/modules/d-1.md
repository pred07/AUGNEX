# Defensive Security Roles Overview

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module defines the identity of the **Protector**. We distinguish between **SOC Analysts**, **Incident Responders**, and **Security Engineers**.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Defense is not just "Installing a Firewall". It is a complex ecosystem of humans and machines working to outsmart an adversary who only needs to be right once.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   The job of a **Tier 1 Analyst**.
*   The high-pressure world of **Incident Response (IR)**.
*   The builder role of **Security Engineering**.

## 2. Core Content

### The Roles
1.  **SOC Analyst (Tier 1/2/3)**:
    *   **Tier 1**: The Triage unit. "Is this alert real?"
    *   **Tier 2**: The Investigator. "How did this happen?"
    *   **Tier 3**: The Hunter. "What did we miss?"

2.  **Incident Responder (CSIRT)**:
    *   The Firefighters. They are called when the building is *already* burning.
    *   Focus: Containment, Eradication, Recovery.

3.  **Security Engineer**:
    *   The Architects. They build the tools the SOC uses (SIEM, EDR configuration).
    *   Focus: Automation and Infrastructure.

### The Adversary Relationship
*   The Attacker moves fast.
*   The Defender must move faster, but also be 100% accurate (False Positives cause burnout).

## 3. Guided Practice

### Role Identification
**Scenario A**:
"A text file appeared on the CEO's desktop demanding Bitcoin."
*   **Who handles it?**: Incident Responder (This is an active breach).

**Scenario B**:
"Splunk is generating 10,000 alerts per hour, drowning the team."
*   **Who fixes it?**: Security Engineer (Tuning the tool).

**Scenario C**:
"An alert says 'Malicious PowerShell detected on HR-PC-01'."
*   **Who sees it first?**: SOC Analyst Tier 1.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Burnout**: Why is SOC Analyst turnover so high? (Alert Fatigue. Staring at screens waiting for bad things leads to stress).
2.  **Career Path**: How does one move from Tier 1 to Tier 3? (By understanding *how* the attack works, not just following the playbook).
3.  **Mindset**: "Assume Breach". What does this mean? (Design your monitoring assuming the attacker is *already* inside).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can describe the hierarchy of a SOC.
2.  You understand that **Engineering** builds the car, **SOC** drives it, and **IR** fixes it when it crashes.
3.  You identify which defensive role suits your personality.
