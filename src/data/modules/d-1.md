# Defensive Security Roles Overview

## 1. Unit Brief: The Blue Team
Defensive security is not just about installing antivirus. It's about designing, building, monitoring, and maintaining secure systems. It's a team sport.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Security Analyst (L1/L2)**: The front line. Watching the SIEM headers. "Is this alert real?"
*   **Security Engineer**: Building the tools (SIEM, EDR, Firewalls) that Analysts use.
*   **Incident Responder**: The firefighters who jump in when the house is burning.
*   **Threat Hunter**: The detectives searching for the fire that hasn't triggered an alarm yet.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Proactive vs Reactive
*   **Proactive**: Hardening, Engineering, Threat Hunting. (Before the hack).
*   **Reactive**: Incident Response, Forensics. (After the hack).

### The "Blue Team" Mindset
*   **Assume Breach**: Stop trying to build a perfect wall. Assume they are already inside. How do you find them?
*   **Visibility**: You cannot defend what you cannot see.

## 4. Practical Examples

### A Day in the Life (L1 Analyst)
1.  **Alert**: "Multiple Failed Logins on HR Server".
2.  **Investigate**: Check the IP address. Is it internal or external?
3.  **Context**: "Oh, it's Bob from IT. He forgot his password."
4.  **Action**: Close alert as False Positive.

### A Day in the Life (Engineer)
1.  **Task**: "We need to stop Bob from downloading malware."
2.  **Action**: Configure the Web Proxy to block all `.exe` downloads from unverified domains.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Thinking Defense is Boring**: Defense is harder than Offense. The attacker only needs to be right once. The defender needs to be right 100% of the time.
*   **Ignoring Business Context**: Blocking *everything* makes the company secure but bankrupt. You balance Security vs Usability.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Defense is Broad**: From coding to networking to psychology.
*   **It's a Career**: Most high-paying CISO roles come from the Defense side.
