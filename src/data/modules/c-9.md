# Coverage Gaps and Blind Spots

## 1. What this module covers
Identifying where you are blind. A blind spot is a place where you have *zero* logs and *zero* protection.

## 2. Why this matters for purple teams
Attacks always migrate to the blind spots. If you monitor Windows, they attack Linux. If you monitor On-Prem, they attack Cloud.

## 3. Core concepts explained clearly

### Technical Blind Spots
*   **Encrypted Traffic (TLS)**: If you don't decrypt, you can't see the payload.
*   **IoT/Printers**: Usually have no AV/EDR. Perfect hiding spots.
*   **Linux/Mac**: Often ignored in "Windows-first" shops.

### Operational Blind Spots
*   **Shift Handovers**: Attacks happening at 6 PM Friday when the shift changes.
*   **Alert Limits**: "If an alert fires > 100 times, auto-close it." (Attacker just floods the alert to hide).

## 4. Validation examples

### The "Unknown Device" Test
1.  **Action**: Plug a Raspberry Pi into the office hallway Ethernet port.
2.  **Expectation**: Network Access Control (NAC) should block it.
3.  **Result**: If it gets an IP and can ping the DC -> **Major Blind Spot**.

### Log Gap Analysis
*   **Test**: Run a command on a Linux Server.
*   **Check**: Does it appear in Splunk?
*   **Result**: "No, we haven't installed the forwarder on Linux yet."

## 5. Common gaps and failures
*   **Shadow IT**: Using AWS accounts on personal credit cards. Security has no visibility until the bill (or the breach) arrives.
*   **Retention**: "We have logs, but only for 24 hours."

## 6. Key takeaways
*   **Inventory**: You can't secure what you don't know exists.
*   **Assume Blindness**: Always ask "Where can't I see?"
