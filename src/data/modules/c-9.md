# Coverage Gaps and Blind Spots

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module defines the **Unknown Unknowns**. What are we missing?

### Fit in the Learning Path
The most dangerous attack is the one happening in your blind spot.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Log Gaps** (No telemetry).
*   **Rule Gaps** (Telemetry exists, but no alert logic).
*   **Skill Gaps** (Alert exists, but analyst doesn't understand it).

## 2. Core Content

### Types of Blind Spots
1.  **Infrastructure**: "We forgot to install EDR on the Linux servers." (Hardware Gap).
2.  **Encryption**: "The traffic is HTTPS, so the IDS is blind." (Visibility Gap).
3.  **Logic**: "We log PowerShell, but we don't look for `DownloadString`." (Detection Gap).

### Finding Them
*   **Purple Teaming**: "Run the attack. Did we see it?" "No." -> Found a gap.
*   **Architecture Review**: "Do we have logs from the DMZ?"

## 3. Guided Practice

### The Assessment
**System**: MacBooks in Marketing Dept.
**Question 1**: Are they on the domain? (No).
**Question 2**: Do they have EDR? (No).
**Question 3**: Do they have access to the File Server? (Yes).

**Conclusion**:
Critical Blind Spot. An attacker can compromise a MacBook (no logs) and attack the File Server. The investigation will show "Valid login from MacBook", with no context on *how* the credentials were stolen.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Encryption**: The biggest modern blind spot. (SSL Inspection is the remediation, but it has privacy/legal issues).
2.  **Containers**: Often a black hole for traditional SOCs.
3.  **Correction**: Don't just list gaps. Prioritize closing them.

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You are honest about what you **cannot** see.
2.  You classify gaps by **Asset**, **Log**, or **Rule**.
3.  You have a plan to illuminate the dark corners.
