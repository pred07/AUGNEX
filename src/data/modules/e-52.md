# Enumeration as a Skill

## 1. Unit Brief: The 90% Rule
Pentesters often say "Enumeration is key". This module unifies the concept. Enumeration isn't a phase you do at the start; it is a continuous loop. **Enumerate -> Attack -> New Access -> Enumerate (New Access) -> Attack...**

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Novice**: Scans port 80. Finds nothing. Gives up.
*   **Expert**: Scans port 80. Fuzzes directories. Finds /backup. Downloads config. Finds Password. SSHs in. Scans internal network. Finds Domain Controller.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Local Enumeration
Once you have valid credentials (or a shell), your view changes.
*   `netstat -ano`: What connections are happening?
*   `env`: What environment variables are set? (Access Keys?)
*   `ps aux`: What processes are running?

### Recursive Emumeration
*   **Found a password in a config file?**
    *   Try it on SSH.
    *   Try it on the Database.
    *   Try it for `sudo`.
    *   Try it on the Web Login.

## 4. Practical Examples

### The Password Re-Use Loop
1.  You crack a database hash: `Spring2023!`.
2.  Don't just log into the DB.
3.  Spray `Spring2023!` against the Active Directory.
4.  Success: You find that the Database Admin uses the same password for their Domain Account.

### Finding Internal Services
`netstat -antp` shows listening ports.
*   `127.0.0.1:8080` (Listening locally).
*   This service was invisible from the outside (Nmap). But now you are inside, you can attack it.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Tunnel Vision**: Getting obsessed with one rabbit hole and forgetting to look at the big picture.
*   **Not taking notes**: "I found a weird file 2 hours ago..." (Where was it? What was the name?). Keep a log.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Try Harder**: Enumeration is boring but necessary.
*   **Re-Evaluate**: Every time you gain a new piece of info/access, re-scan everything with that new context.
