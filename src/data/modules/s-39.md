# Feedback Loops: Intel to Defense

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
Closing the loop. Ensuring Intel actually improves security. Measuring "Intel Effectiveness".

### Learning Objectives
*   Establish **Feedback Channels** with SOC/IR.
*   Measure **True Positive / False Positive** rates.
*   Improve content based on feedback.

---

## 2. Core Content

### The Disconnect
*   Intel Team: "We sent 1000 IOCs!"
*   SOC Team: "They were all garbage noise. We blocked 0 attacks."
*   **Result:** Failure.

### The Loop
1.  **Produce:** Send Intel to SOC.
2.  **Consume:** SOC implements.
3.  **Measure:** SOC reports "This rule fired 10 times. 2 were real, 8 were false."
4.  **Refine:** Intel Analyst tunes the rule.

### Metrics that Matter
*   **MTTD Reduction:** Did Intel help find it faster?
*   **blocks/Alerts:** How many blocks did our feed generate?
*   **Context usage:** Did the IR team use our Actor Profile during the incident?

## 3. Lab: The Post-Mortem
**Incident:** Ransomware Outbreak.
**Review:**
*   Did Intel know about this group? Yes.
*   Did we share the IOCs? Yes.
*   Did SOC block them? No. (Why? Email filters were misconfigured).
*   **Lesson:** Intel was good, Execution failed. Fix execution.

## 4. Completion Criteria
1.  **Identify** the most important metric (Utility/Actionability).
2.  **Explain** how False Positives hurt the Intel team's reputation.
