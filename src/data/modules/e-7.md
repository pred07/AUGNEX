# Passive Reconnaissance Techniques

## 1. Unit Brief: Touching Without Touching
Passive Recon is the practice of gathering intelligence on a target without sending a single packet to their servers. This allows you to map the organization's footprint while remaining completely invisible to their monitoring systems.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Scenario**: A Red Team engagement where stealth is paramount.
*   **Action**: You build a full map of their external infrastructure, employee list, and email format using only public data sources.
*   **Result**: You craft a perfect spear-phishing email without ever triggering a firewall log.

## 3. Core Concepts

### DNS Enumeration (Passive)
Querying public DNS records to find subdomains.
*   **A Records**: IPv4 Addresses.
*   **MX Records**: Mail servers (Often outsourced to Google/O365, but good to know).
*   **TXT Records**: Often leak info (SPF records show authorized sending IPs).

### OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)
Using search engines and databases.
*   **Google Dorks**: Advanced search queries finding leaked files.
*   **Shodan/Censys**: Search engines for devices. They scan the internet so you don't have to.

### The Wayback Machine
Looking at older versions of the website.
*   **Why**: Developers often leave comments or test files in old versions that they "deleted" but are archived.

## 4. Practical Examples

### Using `whois`
```bash
$ whois example.com
Admin Name: John Doe
Admin Email: admin@example.com
```
*   **Intel**: You have a name and an email pattern (`firstname@domain`).

### Investigating DNS with `host`
```bash
$ host -t mx google.com
google.com mail is handled by 10 aspmx.l.google.com.
```
*   **Intel**: The target uses G-Suite. Phishing them with a "Microsoft 365 Password Reset" email will fail. You need to simulate a Google login.

### Google Dorking
Query: `site:target.com filetype:pdf "confidential"`
*   **Result**: Indexed PDF documents that were mistakenly made public.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Touching the Target**: Running `ping target.com` is NOT passive. It sends packets.
*   **Ignoring Metadata**: Configuring your browser to send "Referer" headers when viewing their site (passive web browsing creates logs).

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Invisible**: Passive recon is the only phase where you are truly safe from detection.
*   **Public Data is Gold**: The internet remembers everything. Use it.
