# Passive Reconnaissance Techniques

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers the tools for gathering data without touching the target. We focus on **Whois**, **DNS Dumpster**, and **The Harvester**.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Before you scan an IP, you need to find the IP. Corporations have thousands of hidden domains. These tools find them.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   How to read a **Whois** record.
*   How to enumerate Subdomains using public records.
*   How to find email addresses for Phishing (Conceptually).

## 2. Core Content

### Whois
The public registry of domain ownership.
*   **Data**: Registrar, Registration Date, Tech Contact (sometimes).
*   *Note*: GDPR / Privacy Guard often hides the good stuff now, but historic records might have it.

### Certificate Transparency (CT) Logs
Every time a company buys an SSL certificate for `secure.corp.com`, it is logged publicly.
*   **Source**: `crt.sh`.
*   **Value**: Finds subdomains they wanted to keep secret but needed SSL for.

### Search Engines
*   **Shodan**: Search engine for IoT devices (Routers, Cams, Servers).
*   **Google Dorking**: Advanced search operators.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Using `crt.sh` (Certificate Search)
We will find subdomains of `tesla.com`.

**Step 1**: Open Browser. Go to [crt.sh](https://crt.sh).
**Step 2**: Search for `%.tesla.com`.
**Step 3**: Analyze Results.
*   You will see domains like: `toolbox.tesla.com`, `sso.tesla.com`, `vpn.tesla.com`.
*   **Value**: You just mapped their internal network structure without sending a single packet to Tesla.

### Using `whois` (CLI)
**Step 1**: Open Terminal.
**Step 2**: `whois google.com`.
**Step 3**: Look for "Name Server". (e.g., `ns1.google.com`).

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Privacy**: If you register a domain with your personal home address, can a hacker find it? (Yes, via Whois history).
2.  **Attack Surface**: Why is `dev.corp.com` usually a better target than `www.corp.com`? (Dev environments have weaker security and more bugs).
3.  **Outdated Info**: Why are CT logs sometimes misleading? (They show domains that might have been deleted years ago).

---

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You have successfully used `crt.sh` to find subdomains.
2.  You can invoke `whois` from the terminal.
3.  You understand that the internet remembers everything (Certificate Logs).
