## 2. Core Content

### The Toxic Cycle
*   Red Team: "Lol, I owned you with a macro."
*   Blue Team: "Whatever, I'll just block macros next time and not tell you."
*   Result: Company is less secure.

### The Virtuous Cycle
*   Red Team: "Hey, I found a gap here. How can we fix it together?"
*   Blue Team: "Thanks. Let me write a rule, can you test it?"
*   Result: Company is resilient.

## 3. Guided Practice

### The "Lunch and Learn"
**Activity**: Host a session where Red explains *how* they broke in, and Blue explains *what* they saw.
**Rule**: No ego. No shaming. Just data.

**Scenario**: You found a devastating SQLi.
*   **Bad**: Post it in general chat with a meme.
*   **Good**: Private message the dev, offer to help patch it.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Objective**: Is the goal "Winning" or "Securing"? (It must be Securing).
2.  **Respect**: Defenders have the harder job. They have to be right 100% of the time. Attackers only once. Respect the difficulty.
3.  **Collaboration**: Sit next to them. (Physically or virtually).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You eliminate **Toxic Competition**.
2.  You foster **Psychological Safety**.
3.  You view the other side as **Partners**.
