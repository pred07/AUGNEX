# Improving SOC Efficiency

## 1. What this module covers
Doing more with less. Automating the boring stuff so humans can hunt.

## 2. Why this matters for purple teams
A burnt-out SOC analyst misses alerts. Efficiency = Alertness.

## 3. Core concepts explained clearly

### Contextualization
*   **Inefficient Alert**: "Malware Detected on 192.168.1.5". (Analyst has to look up IP, find Owner, find Location).
*   **Efficient Alert**: "Malware on **Finance-Server-01** (User: **Bob**, Location: **London**)".
*   **How**: Use SIEM lookup tables to enrich logs *before* alerting.

### Grouping (Dedup)
*   Don't send 50 emails for 50 failed logins.
*   Send 1 email: "50 failed logins from User A".

## 4. Validation examples

### The "One Click" Rule
*   **Test**: Measure clicks to verify an alert.
*   **Current State**: Copy IP -> Open VT -> Paste -> Search. (5 clicks, 30 seconds).
*   **Future State**: Click "Check VT" button in SIEM. (1 click, 1 second).

## 5. Common gaps and failures
*   **Swivel Chair**: Using 10 different dashboards (EDR, Firewall, IDP) that don't talk to each other.
*   **Manual Ticketing**: Manually typing "Please reimage host" into ServiceNow. (Script it!).

## 6. Key takeaways
*   **Engineer constraints**: Humans have a limit on how much data they can process. The system must filter the noise.
