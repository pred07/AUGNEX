## 3. Guided Practice

### The Ambassador Program
**Concept**: Recruit non-security people (HR, Finance, Sales) to be "Security Ambassadors".
**Perks**: They get cool swag (Hoodies), early access to features.
**Duty**: They answer basic security questions for their team.
**Result**: Security scales.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Tone**: Don't be the "Policy Police". Be the "Safety Coach".
2.  **Metrics**: Measure "Reporting Rate" (Good), not just "Click Rate" (Bad).
3.  **Executive**: If the CEO doesn't wear the badge, no one will.
