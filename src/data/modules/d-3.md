# Prevention vs Detection vs Response

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module debates the three pillars of defense. **Stop it** (Prevention), **See it** (Detection), and **Fix it** (Response).

### Fit in the Learning Path
In the 90s, we thought we could Prevent everything. Today, we know Prevention eventually fails. Detection is the modern standard.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Prevention**: Firewalls, AV.
*   **Detection**: SIEM, EDR.
*   **Response**: Backups, Reimaging.

## 2. Core Content

### The Three Pillars
1.  **Prevention**: The Wall.
    *   *Goal*: Block the attack before it executes.
    *   *Example*: ACLs, Antivirus signatures.
    *   *Failure*: Zero-days bypass this 100% of the time.

2.  **Detection**: The Camera.
    *   *Goal*: Alert us when the Wall is breached.
    *   *Example*: "Process `mimikatz.exe` ran on Server A".
    *   *Key Metric*: **MTTD** (Mean Time To Detect).

3.  **Response**: The Guard.
    *   *Goal*: Kick the attacker out.
    *   *Example*: "Isolate Host".
    *   *Key Metric*: **MTTR** (Mean Time To Respond).

### The Imbalance
If you spend 100% budget on Prevention, you are "Eggshell Security" (Hard outside, soft inside). Once cracked, you are done.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Categorizing Tools
Place the tool in the correct bucket.

**Tool 1**: Windows Defender (Real-time protection).
*   **Bucket**: Prevention.

**Tool 2**: Splunk (Log analysis).
*   **Bucket**: Detection.

**Tool 3**: Velvet (Forensics tool).
*   **Bucket**: Response.

**Tool 4**: MFA (Multi-Factor Auth).
*   **Bucket**: Prevention.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Dwell Time**: The average attacker stays in a network for 200+ days before detection. Why? (Because defenders focus too much on the perimeter and ignore the internal network).
2.  **Layers**: Why do we need both? (Defense in Depth. Prevention reduces the noise so Detection can find the advanced threats).
3.  **Reality**: If an attacker has valid credentials, does Prevention work? (No. They look like a user. Only Detection (Behavior Analysis) can catch them).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can categorize any security tool into P/D/R.
2.  You understand that **Detection** is the fail-safe for **Prevention**.
3.  You know the terms **MTTD** and **MTTR**.
