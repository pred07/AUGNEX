# Prevention vs Detection vs Response

## 1. Unit Brief: The Defense Triad
You cannot stop everything (Prevention). Therefore, you must spot what gets through (Detection). And when you spot it, you must kick it out (Response).

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Prevention**: Locking your front door.
*   **Detection**: The motion sensor alarm.
*   **Response**: The police showing up.
If you only have a lock (Prevention) but the burglar picks it, they can live in your house forever because you have no Alarm (Detection).

## 3. Core Concepts

### Prevention (Hardening)
Stopping the attack *before* it executes.
*   Firewalls, Patching, MFA, App Whitelisting.
*   *Goal*: Reduce the Attack Surface.

### Detection (Monitoring)
Identifying that an attack *is happening*.
*   IDS rules, SIEM alerts, Antivirus signatures, User Behavior Analytics (UBA).
*   *Goal*: Reduce "Dwell Time" (Time attacker spends unnoticed).

### Response (Action)
Mitigating the attack.
*   Isolating hosts, resetting passwords, blocking IPs, restoring backups.
*   *Goal*: Reduce Impact.

## 4. Practical Examples

### The Ransomware Scenario
1.  **Prevention**: Email Filter blocks 99% of phishing. One slips through. User clicks.
2.  **Detection**: EDR sees `powershell.exe` encrypting files. Raises "High Severity Alert".
3.  **Response**: Automated script kills the process and disconnects the network card.

### The Conflict
*   **Too much Prevention**: "I can't do my job because everything is blocked!" (User friction).
*   **Too much Detection**: "I have 5000 alerts and no time to fix them!" (Noise).

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Prevention Bias**: spending 100% of budget on Firewalls and 0% on Monitoring. "We are secure." (Spoiler: You are not).
*   **Ignoring Response**: Having a great alarm system but nobody works the night shift to check it.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Balance**: You need all three.
*   **Assume Failure**: Prevention *will* fail. What happens next?
