# Credential Abuse and Account Compromise

## 1. Unit Brief: The Identity Crisis
Attackers don't "hack in" anymore; they "log in". Accessing a valid account is stealthy and bypasses most firewalls.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Uber Breach (2022)**: Attacker bought a contractor's password on the Dark Web. Spammed MFA requests (MFA Fatigue) until the user accepted. Logged in to VPN.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Credential Stuffing
*   Users reuse passwords.
*   LinkedIn leaks `bob:password123`.
*   Hacker tries `bob:password123` on Amazon, Netflix, Banking.

### MFA Bypass Techniques
*   **SIM Swapping**: Stealing the phone number to get the SMS code.
*   **AiTM (Adversary in the Middle)**: Fake login page proxies the code to the real site.
*   **MFA Fatigue**: Sending 100 push notifications at 2 AM until user clicks "Approve" to sleep.

## 4. Practical Examples

### Detecting Stuffing
*   **SIEM Alert**: "User Bob logged in from 50 different IPs in 1 hour." (No, wait, that's Spraying).
*   **SIEM Alert**: "1000 Login Failures on the Web Portal from one IP." (Stuffing).

### Defense: FIDO2 Keys
*   Physical Hardware Keys (Yubikey).
*   Immune to Phishing (AiTM) because the Key verifies the domain URL cryptographically.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **"We have SMS MFA, so we are safe"**: SMS is the weakest form of MFA. It is easily intercepted/phished.
*   **No Alerting on Success**: You alert on failed logins. But if the attacker has the correct password, they succeed on the first try. You need UEBA (Behavior Analytics) to spot the anomaly.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **MFA Everywhere**: No exceptions.
*   **Password Managers**: Use unique passwords for every site.
