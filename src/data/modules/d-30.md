# Incident Response Lifecycle (NIST vs SANS)

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers the "Game Day" handbook. **PICERL** (SANS) vs the NIST lifecycle.

### Fit in the Learning Path
When the breach happens, high-level strategy goes out the window. Valid execution of this lifecycle is the difference between a "Minor Incident" and "Headline News".

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Preparation**.
*   **Identification**.
*   **Containment** (Short vs Long term).
*   **Eradication**.
*   **Recovery**.
*   **Lessons Learned**.

## 2. Core Content

### PICERL (SANS)
1.  **P**reparation: Tools, People, Backups ready *before* the hack.
2.  **I**dentification: "We have a problem." (Triage).
3.  **C**ontainment: Stop the bleeding. Isolate host.
4.  **E**radication: Remove the root cause (Reimage, Patch).
5.  **R**ecovery: Restore business.
6.  **L**essons Learned: Post-Mortem.

### Containment Strategies
*   **Disconnect**: Pull the cable. (Cons: Destroys volatile evidence in RAM if you power off).
*   **Isolate**: Vlan Isolation. (Keeps host up but network down).

## 3. Guided Practice

### The Ransomware Scenario
**Event**: Server A is encrypted. Note says "Pay Up".

1.  **Contain**: Disconnect Server A immediately to stop spread.
2.  **Identify**: Scope the damage. Is Server B infected?
3.  **Eradicate**: Wipe Server A. Patch the vulnerability used to enter (RDP?).
4.  **Recover**: Restore from Backup.
5.  **Lessons Learned**: "Why was RDP open?" -> Change Firewall Policy.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Evidence**: Why shouldn't you just wipe the machine immediately? (You destroy the evidence needed to understand *how* they got in. If you don't fix the hole, they will come back tomorrow).
2.  **Communication**: Who talks to the Press? (PR / Legal. NOT the Security Analyst. Loose lips sink ships).
3.  **Panic**: The biggest enemy. (Adhere to the plan).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can recite **PICERL**.
2.  You understand that **Preparation** is the most important phase.
3.  You know the difference between Containment (Stop spread) and Eradication (Fix root cause).
