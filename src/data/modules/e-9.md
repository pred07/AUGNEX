# Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) Fundamentals

## 1. Unit Brief: Weaponizing Public Data
OSINT is intelligence collected from publicly available sources. In the context of offensive security, it's about digging up credentials, code, and infrastructure that the organization accidentally exposed to the world.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
Why spend days trying to bypass a firewall when you can find the VPN password in a leaked database from a 3rd party breach? Hackers take the path of least resistance. Often, that path is OSINT.

## 3. Core Concepts

### GitHub/Code Leaks
Developers often accidentally commit:
*   API Keys (AWS, Stripe).
*   Database Credentials.
*   Hardcoded Passwords.
Tools like `git-secrets` or manual searching can find these.

### Breach Data (Credential Stuffing)
People reuse passwords. If `employee@target.com` used the password `Summer2023!` on LinkedIn, and LinkedIn got hacked, that password is now public.
*   **Attack**: Try `Summer2023!` on the corporate VPN.

### Social Media Correlation
*   **LinkedIn**: Technology stack, org chart.
*   **Twitter/X**: "Frustrated with our new Firewall X!" (Now you know they use Firewall X).

## 4. Practical Examples

### Google Dorking Cheatsheet
Queries to type into Google:
*   `site:pastebin.com "target.com" password` -> Look for pastes.
*   `site:github.com "target.com" "API_KEY"` -> Look for keys.
*   `filetype:xls site:target.com "email"` -> Look for employee lists.

### The GitHub Oops
You search GitHub for "company.com" and sort by "Recently indexed".
*   You find a script `backup.sh`.
*   Inside: `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA...`
*   **Impact**: Full cloud compromise from a single search.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Ignoring Personal Accounts**: Employees often use personal GitHub accounts for work code. Check the employees, not just the official org account.
*   **Underestimating Metadata**: Photos of the office might reveal ID badge types or sticky notes with passwords on monitors.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **The Internet Never Forgets**: Once data is public, it is harvested.
*   **People are the Weak Link**: They reuse passwords and commit secrets.
*   **OSINT > Exploits**: Finding valid credentials is functionally superior to finding a software exploit.
