# Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) Fundamentals

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module goes deeper into **OSINT**. We focus on **Google Dorking** (Advanced Search) and metadata extraction.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Hackers don't just hack servers; they hack people and processes. Finding a PDF containing a password list is easier than cracking a hash.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   Google Operators (`site:`, `filetype:`, `intitle:`).
*   Metadata forensics (EXIF data).
*   Data leakage.

---

## 2. Core Content

### Google Dorking (Google Hacking)
Using advanced operators to find sensitive files indexed by Google.
*   `site:target.com`: Only show results from this domain.
*   `filetype:pdf`: Only show PDFs.
*   `intitle:"index of"`: Find open directory listings.

### Metadata
Files (Word docs, Photos) contain hidden data: Author Name, GPS coordinates, Software Version.
*   *Tool*: `exiftool`.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Google Dorking Drill
Try these queries in Google.

**Query 1: Finding Public PDFs**
`site:nasa.gov filetype:pdf`
*   Result: Thousands of public NASA documents.

**Query 2: Finding Login Portals**
`site:github.com "password"`
*   Result: People accidentally committing passwords to code. (Don't use them!).

**Query 3: Directory Traversal**
`intitle:"index of /" parent directory`
*   Result: Servers that serve raw file lists.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Defense**: How do you stop Google Dorking? (Use `robots.txt` to tell Google not to index sensitive paths, or put them behind a login page).
2.  **Risk**: You find a "Confidential Strategy.docx" on a company's public website. Is it hacking to download it? (Technically no, it's public. But using it is ethically gray/black).
3.  **Human Intel**: If metadata shows "Created by: John Smith", what can you do? (Look up John Smith on LinkedIn, find his email format, craft a phishing email).

---

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You have performed a `site:` search.
2.  You analyze why companies accidentally leak data.
3.  You understand that "Hacking" often starts with a simple search engine query.
