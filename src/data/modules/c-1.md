# Purple Teaming Explained

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module defines **Purple Teaming**. The collaboration between Red (Attack) and Blue (Defense).

### Fit in the Learning Path
Red Teams hide their methods. Blue Teams hide their detections. Purple Team breaks the silos to maximize improvement.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **The Feedback Loop**.
*   **Unit Testing** for Security.
*   **Transparency**.

## 2. Core Content

### The Old Way
*   **Red Team**: Attacks for 2 weeks. Writes a report. "Ha ha, we owned you."
*   **Blue Team**: Feels defeated. Patches 1 thing.
*   *Result*: Antagonism. No learning.

### The Purple Way
*   **Red**: "I am about to run T1003. Check your alerts."
*   **Blue**: "I see nothing."
*   **Red**: "Okay, I'll run it again. Tune your query."
*   **Blue**: "Now I see it!"
*   *Result*: Immediate improvement.

## 3. Guided Practice

### A Purple Session
**Goal**: Detect LSASS Dumping.

1.  Red runs `procdump.exe lsass.exe`.
2.  Blue checks EDR. "Blocked." -> **Success**.
3.  Red runs `rundll32 comsvcs.dll #24`. (Alternate method).
4.  Blue checks EDR. "Nothing." -> **Failure**.
5.  **Engineering Phase**: Blue writes a new rule for `comsvcs.dll` usage.
6.  **Retest**: Logic verified.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Culture**: Why is Purple Teaming hard? (Egos. Red wants to win. Blue doesn't want to look incompetent).
2.  **Frequency**: How often? (Continuous. Not once a year).
3.  **Efficiency**: It turns "Pen Testing" from a "Grade" into a "Lesson".

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You see Red and Blue as **Partners**.
2.  You understand that the goal is **Detection Coverage**.
3.  You value **Transparency** over **Secrecy** (internally).
