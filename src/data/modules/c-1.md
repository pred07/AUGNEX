# Purple Teaming Explained

## 1. What this module covers
Purple Teaming is not a team; it's a function. It is the deliberate collaboration between Red (Attack) and Blue (Defense) to maximize security improvement.

## 2. Why this matters for purple teams
Traditionally, Red Teams attack and write a report. Blue Teams read the report and fix 10% of it. They rarely talk. This silo creates gaps. Purple Teaming breaks the silo to validate defenses in near real-time.

## 3. Core concepts explained clearly

### The Feedback Loop
*   **Red**: "I am running Technique T1003 (Credential Dumping) now."
*   **Blue**: "I see nothing in the SIEM."
*   **Red**: "Okay, I will run it again, but this time I won't obfuscate it."
*   **Blue**: "Now I see it! Our detection rule was too specific."
*   **Result**: Detection tuned in minutes, not months.

### Mindset Shift
*   **Red Goal**: Not to "win" or "humiliate" Blue. Goal is to *train* Blue.
*   **Blue Goal**: Not to "block" Red perfectly. Goal is to *detect* and *respond* to Red.

## 4. Validation examples

### The "Atomic" Test
1.  **Objective**: Validate `lsass.exe` dumping detection.
2.  **Red Action**: `procdump.exe -ma lsass.exe lsass.dmp`
3.  **Blue Query**: `index=edr Image="*procdump.exe*" CommandLine="*lsass*"`
4.  **Result**: If 0 results -> **FAIL**.
5.  **Fix**: Enable EDR rule for "LSASS Access".
6.  **Retest**: Red runs command. Blue sees alert. -> **PASS**.

## 5. Common gaps and failures
*   **The "Us vs Them" Ego**: Red Teamers wanting to look cool by using 0-days that Blue has no chance of catching. This is a waste of money. Use loud, known attacks first to test the basics.
*   **Paper Policy**: "We block Mimikatz". Reality: "We block the filename `mimikatz.exe`, but `mimi.exe` runs fine." Purple Teaming exposes this immediately.

## 6. Key takeaways
*   **Collaboration**: The most effective security control is communication.
*   **Frequency**: A Purple Team exercise should be frequent (e.g., Weekly/Monthly), not an annual event.
