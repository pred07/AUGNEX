# Threat Hunting Principles

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module shifts from "Reactive" (Waiting for Verify) to "Proactive" (Hunting). Assume you are breached. Go find it.

### Fit in the Learning Path
The SIEM only catches what it knows. The Hunter catches the unknown.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Hypothesis-Driven Hunting**.
*   **Outliers**.
*   **Long-Tail Analysis**.

## 2. Core Content

### The Hypothesis
You don't just "look around". You verify a theory.
*   *Hypothesis*: "I bet attackers are using PowerShell to download files."
*   *Query*: `Process=powershell.exe AND Command=Net.WebClient`.

### Outliers (Stack Counting)
Group data by rarity.
*   `svchost.exe`: 500 counts (Normal).
*   `evil.exe`: 1 count (Rare).
*   *Hunt*: Investigate the "Least Frequent" items first. This is "Long Tail Analysis".

## 3. Guided Practice

### The User Agent Hunt
**Hypothesis**: Malware uses a custom User-Agent.

**Action**:
1.  SIEM Query: `stats count by UserAgent`.
2.  Sort by Count (Ascending).
3.  Top: `Mozilla/5.0` (10,000 hits). Ignore.
4.  Bottom: `Python-urllib/2.7` (1 hit). Investigation!

**Result**: A python script on a dev laptop connecting to a shady IP.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Maturity**: Can you Hunt without logs? (No. Hunting requires rich telemetry).
2.  **Metric**: How do you measure Hunting success? (Dwell Time reduction. finding things the automated tools missed).
3.  **Automation**: If a Hunt succeeds, what next? (Turn it into a detection Rule so you don't have to hunt it manually again).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can form a simplistic Hypothesis.
2.  You understand "Stack Counting" (Least Frequency).
3.  You adopt the "Presume Breach" mindset.
