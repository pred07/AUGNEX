# Alert Triage and Prioritization

## 1. Unit Brief: Filtering the Noise
The SOC receives 1000 alerts a day. Triage is the skill of quickly deciding: "Critical", "Important", or "False Positive".

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   If you treat every "Failed Login" as a Crisis, you burnout.
*   If you ignore the "Domain Admin Login" as noise, you get breached.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Contextualization
Checking the 5 Ws:
*   **Who**: Domain Admin? Or Intern?
*   **What**: Accessing a file? Or running `mimikatz`?
*   **Where**: From Internal IP? or from North Korea?
*   **When**: 2 PM? or 3 AM?

### Enrichment
Adding data to the alert.
*   Alert says "IP 1.2.3.4".
*   Enrichment adds: "Location: Russia", "Reputation: Known Botnet", "Owner: Hosting Provider".

## 4. Practical Examples

### Triage: "Malicious Document Detected"
1.  **Check Path**: `C:\Users\Bob\Downloads\Invoice.docx`. (User Action).
2.  **Check Hash**: VirusTotal says 50/60. (Confirmed Malware).
3.  **Check Result**: Antivirus says "Quarantined".
4.  **Priority**: **Low**. (The threat was blocked. Just verify Bob connects to nothing else).

### Triage: "Malicious Document Detected" (Scenario B)
3.  **Check Result**: Antivirus says "Failed to Clean".
4.  **Priority**: **Critical**. (Active infection).

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Closing without notes**: "False Positive". (Why? Write it down: "Bob confirmed he ran this test script").
*   **Assumption**: "It's probably nothing." Never assume. Verify.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Speed vs Accuracy**: You must be fast, but you must be right.
*   **Playbooks**: Use standard procedures for common alerts.
