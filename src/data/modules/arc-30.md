## 2. Core Content

### The POC
Never buy without testing.
*   Define specific success criteria *before* the POC starts.
*   "Must detect Mimikatz."
*   "Must integrate with Jira."

### Negotiation Tactics
1.  **Wait until End of Quarter**: Sales reps are desperate to hit quota. Discounts appear magically on Dec 30th.
2.  **Competition**: "We are looking at CrowdStrike and SentinelOne." Make them fight.
3.  **Term Length**: "I'll sign 3 years for a 30% discount."

## 3. Guided Practice

### The Feature Matrix
**Activity**: Create a matrix.
*   Columns: Solution A, Solution B.
*   Rows: Must-Have Features.
*   *Result*: Automated Score. Remove emotion from the purchase.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Partnership**: Don't squeeze the vendor to death. You need their support when things break.
2.  **VARs**: Value Added Resellers can handle the procurement and give better pricing.
3.  **Renewal**: The negotiation for renewal starts the day you sign. Track usage. If you only used 50 licenses, don't pay for 100 next year.

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You define **Success Criteria**.
2.  You use **Competition** for leverage.
3.  You align purchases with **Fiscal Calendars**.
