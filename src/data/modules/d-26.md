# Introduction to SIEM (Splunk, ELK, Sentinel)

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers the **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**. The brain of the SOC.

### Fit in the Learning Path
You have logs (d-13). You have endpoints (d-21). The SIEM brings them together to find the needle in the haystack.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Ingestion**.
*   **Hot/Warm/Cold** buckets.
*   **SPL** (Search Processing Language).

## 2. Core Content

### The Market Leaders
1.  **Splunk**: The expensive standard. Powerful SPL.
2.  **ELK (Elastic)**: Open Source (mostly). Fast. Hard to manage.
3.  **Sentinel (Microsoft)**: Cloud-native. Great for Azure/Office 365.

### The Function
It's a Google Search for your logs.
*   Query: `index=firewall action=deny | stats count by src_ip`.
*   Result: A table of who is scanning us.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Basic SPL (Splunk Logic)
**Goal**: Find Brute Force.

**Query**:
```splunk
index=wineventlog EventCode=4625
| stats count by AccountName
| where count > 10
```
**Translation**:
1.  Look in Windows logs.
2.  Find Failed Logins.
3.  Count them per User.
4.  Show me only users with > 10 failures.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **GIGO**: Garbage In, Garbage Out. What happens if you don't parse the logs? (You can't search `AccountName`. You have to search raw text, which is slow).
2.  **Cost**: How is Splunk priced? (Usually by GB ingested per day. This forces you to be selective about what you log).
3.  **Speed**: Why do we need "Indexes"? (Like the index in a book. It makes finding "Page 404" instant vs reading the whole book).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can explain what a SIEM does (Aggregate, Correlate, Alert).
2.  You can read a basic pseudo-query.
3.  You understand that SIEM is only as good as the logs you feed it.
