# Geolocation & IMINT (Imagery Intelligence)

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
A picture is worth a thousand data points. IMINT involves analyzing photos and videos to determine **Where** and **When** they were taken. This skill is critical for verifying news, tracking troop movements, or locating a cybercriminal.

### Learning Objectives
*   Identify geographic clues (Flora, Architecture, Signage, Sun/Shadows).
*   Use **SunCalc** to determine time of day.
*   Master **Google Earth Pro** 3D view and historical imagery.

## 2. Core Content

### The Methodology
1.  **Macro:** Continent/Country (look at plugs, driving side, language).
2.  **Meso:** City/Region (look at mountains, skylines, specific transit maps).
3.  **Micro:** Street/Building (look at store names, reflections, street view).

### Shadows & Time
Shadows allow you to determine direction and time.
*   *Morning:* Shadows point West.
*   *Evening:* Shadows point East.
*   *SunCalc.org:* Input date and shadow length to find exact time.

### Tools
*   **Yandex Images:** Often better reverse image search than Google.
*   **Google Earth Pro:** The desktop version allows measuring distances and viewing historical satellite data (e.g., "Was this building here in 2019?").

## 3. Lab: The Vacation Geolocation

### Scenario
Target posts a photo of a coffee cup. Background: A specific bridge and a tram.

1.  **Analyze:** Tram is yellow. Bridge is suspension style.
2.  **Search:** "Yellow tram suspension bridge city".
3.  **Result:** Lisbon, Portugal (25 de Abril Bridge).
4.  **Pinpoint:** Search Google Street View near the bridge for coffee shops with outdoor seating matching the photo angle.
5.  **Confirm:** Found "Lisbon Coffee Co".

## 4. Reflection
1.  Why is the "Horizon" important? (Mountains or skylines on the horizon provide a unique fingerprint that can be matched in Google Earth 3D).
2.  What is "Chronolocation"? (Determining *when* a photo was taken, using weather reports, shadows, or construction progress).
