# Package Management and Updates

## Introduction

In Windows, you go to a website, download an `.exe`, and double-click it. In Linux, we use a central **Package Manager** (like the App Store, but for everything).

## APT (Advanced Package Tool)

Debian-based systems (Kali, Parrot, Ubuntu) use **APT**.

1.  **`apt update`**
    *   Refreshes the list of available software. It doesn't install anything; it just checks "what's new?".
2.  **`apt upgrade`**
    *   Actually downloads and installs the updates for your system.
3.  **`apt install [package_name]`**
    *   Example: `sudo apt install nmap`
4.  **`apt remove [package_name]`**
    *   Uninstalls a specific tool.

## Repositories (sources.list)

Where does APT look? It checks `/etc/apt/sources.list`.
*   If you can't find a tool, your sources list might be missing the "contrib" or "non-free" sections.

## Why This Matters

1.  **Security**: Keeping your OS updated patches vulnerabilities.
2.  **Tooling**: As a pentester, you need the latest versions of exploits and scanners.
