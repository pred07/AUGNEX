# Package Management and Updates

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers how software is installed, updated, and removed in Linux. We focus on **APT** (Advanced Package Tool), the standard for Debian/Kali/Parrot.

### Fit in the Learning Path
In Windows, you download an `.exe` from a website. In Linux, you generally pull from a trusted "Repository". Understanding this supply chain is critical for system maintenance and security.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   The role of **Repositories** (`/etc/apt/sources.list`).
*   The difference between `update` and `upgrade`.
*   How to install tools that aren't in the official repo (GitHub/Python).

## 2. Core Content

### The Repository Model
Linux distros maintain a central database of approved software.
*   **Safety**: Software is signed by the maintainers.
*   **Dependency Hell**: The package manager automatically installs the libraries your tool needs.

### APT Commands
1.  **update**: Downloads the *list* of available versions. (Doesn't install anything).
2.  **upgrade**: Compares your installed versions to the list and installs the new ones.
3.  **install**: Downloads and sets up specific software.
4.  **remove**: Uninstalls software.

### Sources.list
The file `/etc/apt/sources.list` tells APT where to look.
*   *Security Risks*: Adding a random PPA (Personal Package Archive) or 3rd party repo can compromise your system.

## 3. Guided Practice

### managing Tools
We will install a harmless tool, check for updates, and then remove it.

**Step 1: Refresh the Database**
```bash
sudo apt update
```
*   **Output**: URLs starting with `http... kali-rolling...`

**Step 2: Install 'Neofetch'**
A common tool to display system info.
```bash
sudo apt install neofetch -y
neofetch
```
(Admire the logo).

**Step 3: Remove it**
```bash
sudo apt remove neofetch
```
*   **Note**: This removes the binary. To remove config files too, use `apt purge`.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Supply Chain**: If a hacker compromises the official Kali Repository, what happens to everyone who runs `apt upgrade`?
2.  **Offline**: How do you install software on an air-gapped machine (no internet)? (Hint: `.deb` files and `dpkg`).
3.  **Version freeze**: Why do servers often use "Stable" repos while hacking distros use "Rolling" repos?

---

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You have run `apt update` successfully (no 404 errors).
2.  You have installed and run `neofetch`.
3.  You understand that `apt update` does not actually update your software, just the list.
