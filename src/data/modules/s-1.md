# The Sentinel Mindset: Intelligence as Engineering

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This is not a "Cyber Awareness" course. This is the **Sentinel** path. You are not here to patch servers (Builder) or break them (Breaker). You are here to **know**. This module establishes the mental model of the Intelligence Professional: Accuracy, Speed, and the rejection of Assumptions.

### Fit in the Learning Path
This is Module 0. Everything that follows—OSINT, Malware Analysis, Geopolitics—relies on the mental foundation built here. If your mind is flawed, your intelligence will be flawed.

### Learning Objectives
*   Adopt the **"So What?"** doctrine.
*   Differentiate **Data** vs **Information** vs **Intelligence**.
*   Understand the **Intelligence Lifecycle** (F3EAD) as a weapon system.

## 2. Core Content

### The Hierarchy of Value
Most "Intel" teams are just "News" teams. They forward links. Do not be that analyst.

1.  **Data:** Raw signals. "IP 1.2.3.4". (Value: Zero).
2.  **Information:** Contextualized data. "IP 1.2.3.4 is scanning port 445." (Value: Low).
3.  **Intelligence:** Actionable insight. "IP 1.2.3.4 is scanning port 445, belongs to the 'WannaCry' infrastructure, and we are vulnerable. **Block it.**" (Value: High).

### The "So What?" Doctrine
Every time you find something, ask "So What?" three times.
*   *Observation:* "I found a leaked credential."
*   *So What?* "It belongs to a Database Admin."
*   *So What?* "If used, they can dump the entire Customer Table."
*   *So What?* "We need to reset it within 10 minutes or we face a GDPR fine." -> **This is the Intelligence.**

### Bias is the Enemy
*   **Mirror Imaging:** "I wouldn't attack on a Sunday, so they won't." (Wrong. They live in a different timezone).
*   **Confirmation Bias:** "I think it's APT29, so I ignore evidence pointing to eCrime."

## 3. Lab: The Filter
**Scenario:** You receive 100 alerts. 99 are noise. 1 is critical.
**Task:** Identify the Intelligence.
1.  "User failed login" (Noise).
2.  "Port scan blocked" (Noise).
3.  "PowerShell executed `Invoke-Mimikatz` on the Domain Controller" (**CRITICAL INTELLIGENCE**).

## 4. Operational Reality
You are the **radar** for the defense. The firewall is the shield. The EDR is the sword. But you tell them where to point. If you are wrong, they defend the wrong flank. **Accuracy is paramount.**

## 5. Completion Criteria
1.  **Define** the difference between Information and Intelligence.
2.  **Explain** why "Mirror Imaging" leads to intelligence failure.
