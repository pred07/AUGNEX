# Legal Authorization, Scope, and Rules of Engagement

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module protects you from prison. We cover the **Rules of Engagement (RoE)**, Scope definitions, and the concept of "Get Out of Jail Free" cards.

### Fit in the Learning Path
You are learning to use weapons. You must learn the safety rules before you load the ammunition.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   What makes a contract binding.
*   **In-Scope** vs **Out-of-Scope**.
*   The "Stop Test" conditions.

## 2. Core Content

### The Authorization Letter
You never attack without a signed document containing:
1.  **Specific Targets**: IPs, URLs, Domains.
2.  **Time Window**: "Testing allowed between 09:00 and 17:00 EST".
3.  **Contact Info**: Who to call if you accidentally crash the server.

### Scope Creep (The Trap)
*   **Scenario**: The client owns `abc.com`. You find a link to `aws-bucket.com` (hosted by Amazon).
*   **Danger**: You do NOT have permission to test Amazon's infrastructure unless explicitly authorized. Poking the bucket is a crime.

### Rules of Engagement (RoE)
*   **Destructive Testing**: Allowed? (Usually No).
*   **Social Engineering**: Allowed? (Must be specified).
*   **Exfiltration**: Can you download real data? (Usually No - proof of access is enough).

## 3. Guided Practice

### Scoping Exercise
Read this Scope Check.

**Authorized Scope**: `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.5`.

**Scenario**:
You scan `192.168.1.5` and find it connects to a database at `192.168.1.50`.
You scan `192.168.1.50`.

**Verdict**:
**FAIL**. You attacked `192.168.1.50`. It was not in the IP list. Even if the client owns it, you did not have permission *documented* for that IP.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Third Parties**: Why is testing a client's Cloudflare WAF tricky? (Because Cloudflare is a third party. You might get banned by Cloudflare).
2.  **Emergency**: If you accidentally run `rm -rf` on a production server, what do you do? (Stop immediately. Call the emergency contact. Admit it clearly).
3.  **Ethics**: A client asks you to "Hack my competitor". What do you say? ("No." Then you leave).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can define "Scope" in a legal context.
2.  You treat the Authorizations Letter as your most important tool.
3.  You understand that hacking *competitors* is corporate espionage, not pentesting.
