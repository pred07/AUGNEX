# Networking Fundamentals (OSI & TCP/IP)

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module deals with how computers talk. We break down the **OSI Model** (7 Layers) and the **TCP/IP Model** (4 Layers).

### Fit in the Learning Path
Network attacks (Man-in-the-Middle, Spoofing, DoS) exploit specific layers of these models. You need a mental map of where the data is flowing.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   encapsulation (Matryoshka dolls of data).
*   The difference between a **Switch** (Layer 2) and a **Router** (Layer 3).
*   The "Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away" mnemonic.

## 2. Core Content

### The OSI Model (7 Layers)
1.  **Physical (L1)**: Cables, Wi-Fi radio waves. (Bits).
2.  **Data Link (L2)**: MAC Addresses. Switches. (Frames).
3.  **Network (L3)**: IP Addresses. Routers. (Packets).
4.  **Transport (L4)**: TCP/UDP Ports. (Segments).
5.  **Session (L5)**: Managing connections.
6.  **Presentation (L6)**: Encryption/Formatting (JPEG, ASCII).
7.  **Application (L7)**: The actual data (HTTP, FTP).

### Encapsulation
When you send an email:
1.  **L7** Creates the data.
2.  **L6** Encrypts it (SSL).
3.  **L4** Adds a Port (Source/Dest).
4.  **L3** Adds an IP (Source/Dest).
5.  **L2** Adds a MAC (Source/Dest).
6.  **L1** Sends electrical pulses down the wire.

The receiver reverses this process (Decapsulation).

## 3. Guided Practice

### Inspecting Layers with Wireshark (Conceptual)
We will use a mental exercise since we haven't installed Wireshark yet.

**Scenario**: You visit `google.com`.

**Step 1: Layer 1**
Your Wi-Fi card transmits radio frequencies to the Access Point.

**Step 2: Layer 2**
Your card says "From My MAC Address, To the Router's MAC Address".

**Step 3: Layer 3**
Your card says "From My IP (192.168.1.5), To Google's IP (8.8.8.8)".

**Step 4: Layer 4**
"From Port 49152 (Random), To Port 443 (HTTPS)".

**Step 5: Layer 7**
"GET /search?q=cybersecurity".

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Attack Vector**: If I cut the cable, what Layer attack is that? (Layer 1 - Physical Denial of Service).
2.  **Spoofing**: If I change my MAC address, which Layer am I affecting? (Layer 2).
3.  **Routing**: Why do switches generally not care about IP addresses? (Because they operate at L2, looking only at MACs).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can list all 7 layers of the OSI model.
2.  You understand that data gets "wrapped" in headers as it moves down the stack.
3.  You know that IP addresses are L3 and MAC addresses are L2.
