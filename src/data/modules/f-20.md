# Networking Fundamentals (OSI & TCP/IP)

## Introduction

Networks are layers of abstraction. To understand how data moves from your phone to a server in Japan, we use models.

## The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)

This is the standard 7-layer model. You must memorize this.

1.  **Physical**: Cables, Wi-Fi radio waves, Hubs. (Bits).
2.  **Data Link**: MAC Addresses, Switches. (Frames).
3.  **Network**: IP Addresses, Routers. (Packets).
4.  **Transport**: TCP/UDP, Ports. (Segments).
5.  **Session**: Managed connections.
6.  **Presentation**: Encryption (TLS), Formatting (JPEG).
7.  **Application**: HTTP, DNS, SMTP. (User Interaction).

## The TCP/IP Model

The internet actually runs on this simpler 4-layer model:

1.  **Network Interface** (Physical + Data Link)
2.  **Internet** (Network)
3.  **Transport** (Transport)
4.  **Application** (Session + Presentation + Application)

## Encapsulation

When you send a message, it gets wrapped like an envelope inside an envelope.
*   **Data** -> wrapped in **TCP** (Port) -> wrapped in **IP** (Address) -> wrapped in **Ethernet** (MAC).

## Why This Matters

Firewalls work at different layers.
*   A **Layer 3 Firewall** blocks IP addresses.
*   A **Layer 7 Firewall (WAF)** blocks malicious HTTP text (like SQL Injection).
You need to know which layer you are attacking.
