# Initial Access Techniques

## 1. Unit Brief: The First Step
How does the hacker get from the Internet to your Internal Network? This is the "Initial Access" phase of MITRE ATT&CK.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
If you stop Initial Access, you stop the breach before it starts.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Top Methods
1.  **Phishing**: Email with link or attachment. (90% of breaches).
2.  **Exploiting Public Applications**: SQLi on Website, RCE on VPN Gateway (Citrix bleed).
3.  **Valid Accounts**: Buying password dumps on the Dark Web and logging in via VPN.
4.  **Supply Chain**: Hacking the software update server (SolarWinds).

## 4. Practical Examples

### The RDP Exposure
Shodan Search: `port:3389 org:Target`.
*   Found: 5 Servers with RDP open.
*   Attack: Brute force the Admin password.

### Drive-By Download
*   User visits `news-site.com` (which was hacked).
*   Site serves a malicious ad (Malvertising).
*   Browser is outdated -> Remote Code Execution -> Malware installed.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Focusing on Zero-Days**: "We need to patch this 0-day!" Meanwhile, your users answer emails asking for their passwords. Phishing is easier than Zero-Days.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Hardening the Edge**: Reduce the attack surface. Shut down unused portals.
*   **User Training**: The user is the perimeter.
