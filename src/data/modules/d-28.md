# Alert Fatigue and Tuning

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers the "Human Factor". What happens when the alarm rings 1000 times a day? You ignore it.

### Fit in the Learning Path
More alerts != More security. Quality > Quantity.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **False Positives** (FP).
*   **False Negatives** (FN).
*   **Tuning** (Whitelisting).

## 2. Core Content

### The Math of Fatigue
*   Efficiency = True Positives / Total Alerts.
*   If you have 99 False Positives for every 1 True Positive, your analysts will quit.
*   *Goal*: Reduce FPs without increasing FNs.

### Tuning Strategies
1.  **Deduplication**: Combine 50 "Failed Login" alerts into 1 "Brute Force" alert.
2.  **Contextual Whitelisting**: "Alert on PowerShell, EXCEPT if run by the SCCM Admin Account".
3.  **Severity Adjustment**: Downgrade "Adware" to Low connectivity.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Tuning a Rule
**Rule**: "Alert on usage of `psexec.exe`".
**Reality**: The Helpdesk uses `psexec` to fix printers remotely.
**Result**: 500 alerts/day.

**Tune**:
`Image=psexec.exe AND User!=Helpdesk_Service_Account`

**Risk**:
What if the attacker steals the Helpdesk Service Account?
*   *Trade-off*: We accept this risk to make the alerts manageable, OR we monitor the Service Account for *abnormal* behavior instead.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Wolf**: The "Boy Who Cried Wolf" is the defining story of SOCs.
2.  **Ownership**: Who creates FPs? (Usually the Security Engineer). Who suffers? (The Analyst). The feedback loop needs to be tight.
3.  **Testing**: How do you know you didn't tune out a real attack? (Purple Teaming. Run a simulation to see if it catches it).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You prioritize **High Fidelity** alerts.
2.  You understand the danger of a False Negative (Silence).
3.  You respect the Analyst's time.
