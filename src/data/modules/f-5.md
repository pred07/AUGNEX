# Installing Parrot OS Safely

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module introduces Parrot Security OS as an alternative attack platform to Kali Linux. You will understand the philosophical and technical differences between these distributions, when to prefer one over the other, and how Parrot's privacy-focused features add capabilities not present in Kali. This is not about which is "better"—it's about understanding your options.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Having installed Kali, you now explore an alternative approach. Security professionals should be tool-agnostic—the OS is a vehicle for the tools, and understanding multiple platforms makes you more versatile. Parrot offers different trade-offs that may suit your needs better in certain scenarios.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will:
*   Compare Kali and Parrot across technical and usability dimensions
*   Understand Parrot's privacy-first design philosophy
*   Choose the appropriate distribution for specific use cases
*   (Optional) Install and configure Parrot Security OS

## 2. Core Content

### Mental Model: Tool Distribution Philosophy

**How professionals think about this:**
The operating system is a platform, not a skill. Whether you use Kali, Parrot, BlackArch, or plain Debian with added tools, the commands and techniques are identical. What differs is:
- Pre-installed tool selection
- Default configuration philosophy
- Resource consumption
- Privacy/anonymity features
- Long-term maintenance approach

**The professional chooses based on context, not brand loyalty.**

### Kali vs Parrot: Technical Comparison

| Dimension | Kali Linux | Parrot Security OS |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| **Base** | Debian Testing | Debian Testing |
| **Desktop Environment** | XFCE (default) | MATE (default) |
| **Design Philosophy** | Pure penetration testing platform | Multi-purpose security OS |
| **Resource Usage** | Higher (~800MB RAM idle) | Lower (~350-500MB RAM idle) |
| **Update Model** | Rolling release | Rolling release |
| **Privacy Tools** | Minimal defaults | AnonSurf, Tor, I2P integrated |
| **Editions** | Single focus (+ ARM, containers) | Security, Home, Cloud, Architect |
| **Maintainer** | OffSec (commercial) | Parrot Security CIC (community) |
| **Official Certs** | OSCP uses Kali | None (independent) |

### Parrot's Privacy-First Design

**Built-in anonymity features:**

**AnonSurf:**
- One-command Tor routing for all system traffic
- Clears traces on exit
- Simpler than manual Tor configuration

```bash
# Enable system-wide Tor routing
sudo anonsurf start

# Check status  
sudo anonsurf status

# Disable and cleanup
sudo anonsurf stop
```

**Warning:** AnonSurf provides anonymity for network traffic, NOT:
- Browser fingerprinting resistance
- Application-level deanonymization
- Operational security mistakes
- Traffic analysis from timing

**Additional privacy tools:**
- MAT2 (Metadata Anonymization Toolkit)
- OnionShare for anonymous file sharing
- Encrypted container utilities
- Privacy-focused browser configurations

### Parrot Editions Explained

| Edition | Purpose | Tools Included |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Security** | Full offensive security suite | 600+ security tools |
| **Home** | Privacy-focused daily driver | Development tools, privacy apps, no attack tools |
| **Cloud** | Docker/container deployment | Minimal, containerized tools |
| **Architect** | Custom installation | Meta-packages for build-your-own |
| **Raspberry Pi** | ARM devices | Varies by image |

**For this course:** Install the **Security Edition** to match Kali's capabilities.

### When to Choose Parrot Over Kali

**Choose Parrot when:**
- Running on lower-spec hardware (4GB RAM or less)
- Privacy/anonymity features are important
- You want a more "daily-driver" feel
- You appreciate the community-driven development model
- You're using older or unusual hardware (better driver support sometimes)

**Choose Kali when:**
- Preparing for OffSec certifications (OSCP, OSWE, etc.)
- Following tutorials that assume Kali (default for most)
- Working in environments where Kali is standard
- You want the largest community for troubleshooting

**Practical reality:**
For 95% of security work, they're interchangeable. Both run the same Debian packages, the same tools execute identically, and skills transfer completely.

### Feature Deep Dive: Things Parrot Does Differently

#### 1. Sandboxed Applications (Firejail Integration)
Parrot includes Firejail profiles for sandboxing applications:

```bash
# Run Firefox in sandbox
firejail firefox

# Run a command with network isolation
firejail --net=none malware_analysis_tool
```

**Security benefit:** Compromised applications can't access your full system.

#### 2. Battery Optimization
Parrot includes TLP by default for power management—better for laptops during mobile assessments.

#### 3. Development Environment
Parrot Home/Security includes full development stacks (Python, Ruby, Go, Node.js) configured out of the box.

#### 4. Undercover Mode
Transforms the desktop to look like Windows 10:

```bash
undercover
```

**Use case:** Working in public spaces where an obvious hacking OS draws attention.

### Installation Overview (Similar to Kali)

**Installer differences:**
- Parrot uses **Calamares** installer (graphical, modern)
- More visually polished than Debian installer
- Similar options, friendlier interface

**Steps:**
1. Download from https://www.parrotsec.org/download/
2. Verify SHA256 checksum
3. Create VM (same specs as Kali)
4. Boot ISO and select "Install Parrot"
5. Follow Calamares wizard
6. Post-install: Update and snapshot

**Default credentials:**
- Username: `parrot` (or your created user)
- Password: Set during installation

### Tool Availability Comparison

Most tools exist in both. Notable differences:

| Tool | Kali | Parrot |
|------|------|--------|
| AnonSurf | No (install manually) | Yes, Built-in |
| I2P | No | Yes, Built-in |
| Firejail | No (install manually) | Yes, Configured |
| Aircrack-ng | Yes | Yes |
| Metasploit | Yes | Yes |
| Burp Suite | Yes | Yes |
| Nmap | Yes | Yes |

**Key insight:** The core security tools are identical. Differences are in supporting infrastructure.

### Resource Consumption Benchmark

Typical idle resource usage:

| Metric | Kali XFCE | Parrot MATE |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| RAM (idle) | ~700-900MB | ~400-600MB |
| Disk (base install) | ~12GB | ~10GB |
| Boot time (SSD) | ~15-20s | ~12-18s |

**Practical impact:** On 4GB RAM machine, Parrot leaves more room for running tools simultaneously.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Exercise 1: Resource Comparison

If you installed Kali in the previous module, measure and record:

| Metric | Your Kali VM |
|--------|--------------|
| RAM usage (idle) | ___ MB |
| Disk usage | ___ GB |
| Boot time | ___ seconds |

**Compare with Parrot specs above.** Would the difference matter for your hardware?

### Exercise 2: Tool Verification

Tools are tools. Verify this by comparing tool versions:

```bash
# In Kali:
nmap --version

# In Parrot (if installed):
nmap --version
```

Are they the same version? Do they produce identical output? Try a scan of `localhost`.

### Exercise 3: Anonymity Features

Research AnonSurf:

1. What network traffic does AnonSurf NOT anonymize? _______________
2. How would you verify your IP is anonymized? _______________
3. What are three activities that can deanonymize you even with AnonSurf active? _______________

---

## 4. Reflection Check

### Technical Understanding
1. If Nmap is identical on both systems, why do people argue about which OS is "better"?

2. A colleague insists you must use Kali because "it's what the pros use." How do you respond?

3. You're on an engagement and need to quickly research something online anonymously. You have Parrot. What command do you run?

### Operational Thinking
1. You're going to take the OSCP exam. Which OS should you practice on? Why?

2. You're doing wireless pentesting from a coffee shop. Which privacy features might be useful?

3. Your laptop only has 4GB RAM. You need maximum tools available during a mobile assessment. Which OS do you choose?

## 5. Key Misconceptions

**MYTH: "One is better than the other"**
REALITY: They're different trade-offs. Professionals choose based on context, not tribalism.

**MYTH: "I need to install both to be complete"**
REALITY: Pick one as primary. The skills transfer. You can always switch later.

**MYTH: "Parrot's anonymity features make me invisible"**
REALITY: AnonSurf anonymizes network traffic. Operational security, browser behavior, and application leaks can still identify you.

**MYTH: "Kali is only for hacking, Parrot is for daily use"**
REALITY: Neither is designed as a daily driver. Parrot is more comfortable for it, but both are specialized tools.

**MYTH: "The Home Edition is useless for security work"**
REALITY: Parrot Home is excellent for development and privacy without attack tools. Install tools as needed via apt.
