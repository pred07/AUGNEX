# Installing Parrot OS Safely

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module introduces **Parrot Security OS**, a popular alternative to Kali Linux. You do not *need* both, but you should know both.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Some professionals prefer Parrot because it is lighter on resources and more "daily driver" friendly than Kali. We cover it so you have a choice.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   The key differences between Kali and Parrot.
*   How to install Parrot OS in a VM.
*   The "Home" vs "Security" editions of Parrot.

## 2. Core Content

### Parrot vs Kali
| Feature | Kali Linux | Parrot Security OS |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **base** | Debian | Debian |
| **Desktop** | XFCE (Default) | MATE (Default) |
| **Feel** | Pure Utility | Daily Driver OS |
| **Tools** | Everything | Curated Selection |
| **Privacy** | Standard | Anonsurf (Tor) Built-in |

### Editions
Parrot offers multiple versions:
*   **Security Edition**: Comes with all hacking tools. (Download this ONE).
*   **Home Edition**: Lightweight, no hacking tools. Good for developers.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Installation Workflow
The process is nearly identical to Kali, with different visuals.

**Step 1: Download**
1.  Go to [parrotsec.org](https://www.parrotsec.org/).
2.  Download **Parrot Security Edition** ISO.

**Step 2: Hypervisor Config**
1.  Create New VM.
2.  **Type**: Linux. **Version**: Debian (64-bit).
3.  **RAM**: 4GB.

**Step 3: Installation Difference**
Parrot uses the "Calamares" installer, which looks much more like a standard Windows/Mac installer than Kali's text-based one.
1.  Boot the ISO.
2.  Run "Install Parrot".
3.  Follow the wizard.

### Comparison Task
If you installed Kali in the previous module, install Parrot now. Compare the **boot time** and **RAM usage** of both when idle.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Tool Agnosticism**: If `nmap` is installed on both Kali and Parrot, does it behave differently? (Hint: No. Tools are tools).
2.  **Preference**: Why might a user with an older laptop prefer Parrot?
3.  **Anonymity**: Parrot includes "Anonsurf" to route traffic through TOR. Is this enough to make you invisible? (Hint: No).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You understand that the OS is just a wrapper for the tools.
2.  You have successfully installed Parrot OS (Optional if you already have Kali).
3.  You have chosen your "Primary" attack platform for the rest of the course.
