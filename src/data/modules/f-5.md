# Installing Parrot OS Safely

## Introduction

Parrot Security OS (ParrotSec) is a popular alternative to Kali. It is known for being more lightweight and having a more modern-looking interface (MATE desktop). Some professionals prefer it for daily driving.

## Why Two Distros?

In professional environments, you never rely on just one tool. If Kali breaks or a tool version is buggy, you switch to Parrot. We will install it to ensure redundancy.

## Step 1: Download

1.  Go to `parrotsec.org`.
2.  Navigate to **Download** -> **Security Edition**.
3.  Download the **ISO (AMD64)** file.

## Step 2: Configure the VM

1.  Open VirtualBox/VMware.
2.  Click **New**.
3.  **Name**: `Parrot-Sec-Lab`.
4.  **Type**: Linux.
5.  **Version**: Debian (64-bit).
6.  **RAM**: 4096 MB recommended.
7.  **Disk**: Create a new VDI, **25GB** size.

## Step 3: Installation

1.  Boot the VM with the Parrot ISO.
2.  Select **"Install"** -> **"Standard Installer"**.
3.  **Language/Region**: Select preferences.
4.  **Root Password**: Set a strong root password.
5.  **User Account**: Create a standard user (e.g., `student`).
6.  **Partitioning**: "Guided - use entire disk".
7.  **Install GRUB**: Yes, to the primary drive.

## Comparing Kali vs Parrot

| Feature | Kali | Parrot |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base** | Debian Testing | Debian Stable |
| **Desktop** | XFCE (default) | MATE (default) |
| **Philosophy** | Pure Offense | Security + Privacy + Dev |
| **Feel** | Raw | Polished |

## Output Verification

Once installed, verify the kernel version:
```bash
uname -r
```

## Conclusion

You now have two distinct attack platforms. This diversity prevents you from being stuck if one OS has a dependency issue.
