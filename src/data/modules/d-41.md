# Secure Configuration Baselines

## 1. Unit Brief: Infrastructure as Code
A Baseline is a "Golden Image" or a standard config file that every server starts with. It ensures security from birth.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Manual Build**: Admin installs Windows, forgets to disable SMBv1. Vulnerable.
*   **Baseline Build**: Automated script installs Windows and applies GPO. Secure.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Group Policy (GPO)
The Windows way to enforce settings on 10,000 PCs.
*   "Force Screen Lock after 5 mins".
*   "Disable USB".

### Configuration Drift
*   Server A matches baseline.
*   Admin changes setting on Server A to fix a printer.
*   Server A has "Drifted". It is no longer standard.
*   **Solution**: Agent monitors drift and reverts it (Puppet/Chef/Salt).

## 4. Practical Examples

### S3 Buckets
*   **Baseline**: "Block Public Access = True".
*   **Enforcement**: AWS Config rule auto-remediates any bucket that is made public.

### Docker Images
*   **Golden Image**: A scanned, hardened Container Image. Developers must use THIS image, not pull `node:latest` from Docker Hub.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Exceptions**: Granting too many exceptions ("CEO needs USB"). Eventually, the baseline effectively disappears.
*   **Not updating**: The baseline from 2018 is insecure in 2024. Review annually.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Automation**: Security at scale requires automation.
*   **Consistency**: Cattle, not Pets. Every server should be identical.
