# Effective Security Writing

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers **Communication**. Translating "geek" to "business".

### Fit in the Learning Path
If you find a Critical Bug but write a confusing report, it won't get fixed. Writing is a technical skill.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **BLUF** (Bottom Line Up Front).
*   **Audience Analysis**.
*   **Tone** (Objective, not Alarmist).

## 2. Core Content

### The Structure
1.  **Executive Summary**: For the Manager. (Cost, Risk, Impact). No tech jargon.
2.  **Technical Details**: For the Engineer. (Steps to Reproduce, Code snippets).
3.  **Remediation**: How to fix it.

### BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)
Don't bury the lead.
*   *Bad*: "We ran Nmap and then we saw..."
*   *Good*: "We found a Critical Vulnerability in the Payment Gateway that allows data theft."

## 3. Guided Practice

### rewriting a Finding
**Bad**: "The server has port 445 open and it's bad because EternalBlue can hack it."
**Good**:
*   **Issue**: Unpatched SMB Service detected.
*   **Risk**: High. Allows remote code execution.
*   **Recommendation**: Apply Patch MS17-010 immediately.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Accuracy**: Never guess. If you aren't sure, say "Potential".
2.  **Passive Voice**: Avoid "It was found that...". Use "We identified...".
3.  **Empathy**: Don't mock the developers. "The code is garbage" -> "The code lacks input validation".

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can write an Executive Summary in 3 sentences.
2.  You distinguish between **Fact** and **Opinion**.
3.  You write to **Help**, not to **Impress**.
