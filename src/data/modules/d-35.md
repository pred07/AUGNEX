# Containment Strategies

## 1. Unit Brief: Stop the Bleeding
You found an active hacker. If you watch them, they steal data. If you unplug the server, you lose business. Containment is the middle ground.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Ransomware**: You have minutes. Containment must be automated.
*   **Espionage**: You have weeks. You might want to watch them to learn their goals (Honeypotting) before cutting them off.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Isolation Methods
*   **Network (VLAN)**: Move the infected PC to a "Quarantine VLAN" that has no internet and no internal access.
*   **Endpoint (EDR)**: Click "Isolate Host". The agent blocks all traffic except to the management server.
*   **Account**: Disable the User Account in Active Directory. Reset Ticket Granting Ticket (krbtgt).

### Segmentation
Stopping Lateral Movement.
*   "The breach is in the DMZ. Cut the link between DMZ and Internal."

## 4. Practical Examples

### The Ransomware Button
1.  Alert: Encryption detected on Laptop A.
2.  SOAR Playbook:
    *   Isolate Laptop A (EDR).
    *   Disable User A (AD).
    *   Scan for same hash on all other PCs.

### "Pulling the Plug"
When to physically unplug power/network:
*   Only if software isolation fails and data loss is imminent.
*   *Downside*: Risky for forensics (RAM loss).

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Emailing the Hacker**: Sending "Stop it!" to the attacker. (They will just laugh and speed up).
*   **Tipping your hand**: Resetting the password before you understand the scope. The hacker sees the reset, triggers their logic bomb, and wipes the server.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Scope First**: Don't contain ONE machine if the hacker controls TEN. Find them all first, then contain all at once (Whac-A-Mole).
