# Threat Intelligence (CTI) Fundamentals

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)**. Knowing the enemy. **IOCs** vs **TTPs**.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Sun Tzu: "If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles."

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Strategic vs Tactical vs Operational** Intel.
*   **Pyramid of Pain**.
*   **Sharing** (TLP - Traffic Light Protocol).

## 2. Core Content

### Types of CTI
1.  **Strategic**: For CEOs. "Ransomware is up 20% in our vertical."
2.  **Operational**: For Hunters. "Group APT29 uses this specific tool."
3.  **Tactical**: For SIEMs. "Block IP 1.2.3.4".

### The Pyramid of Pain (David Bianco)
*   **Hash/IP**: Easy for attacker to change. Low value for defender.
*   **Domain**: Trivial.
*   **Tools**: Annoying.
*   **TTPs (Tactics)**: Hard. If you detect their *Method*, they have to relearn how to hack. High value.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Using a Feed.
**Scenario**: Is `1.2.3.4` bad?
**Tool**: AbuseIPDB, AlienVault OTX.
**Action**: Search IP.
*   **Result**: "Reported 50 times for SSH Scanning."
*   **Decision**: Block it.

### TLP (Traffic Light Protocol)
*   **Red**: Eyes Only. Do not share.
*   **Amber**: Share within limited group (Org).
*   **Green**: Share with partners.
*   **Clear**: Public.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Decay**: Do IPs stay bad forever? (No. Hackers use cloud IPs. Tomorrow that IP might be a legitimate Amazon shop. Old Threat Intel is worthless).
2.  **Attribution**: Does it matter if it was "Russia" or "China"? (For the government? Yes. For the SOC? No. A shell is a shell. Block it).
3.  **Consumption**: Don't just consume. Contribute.

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can draw the **Pyramid of Pain**.
2.  You value **TTPs** over **IPs**.
3.  You know what **TLP:AMBER** means.
