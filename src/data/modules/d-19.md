# Baseline Network Behavior

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers **Baselining**. Knowing what "Normal" looks like so you can spot "Abnormal".

### Fit in the Learning Path
You cannot find "Evil" if you don't know "Good".

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Traffic Volume**.
*   **Protocol usage**.
*   **Timing analysis**.

---

## 2. Core Content

### What is Normal?
*   **Servers**: High traffic 9-5? Or 24/7? (Backup servers spike at 2am).
*   **Users**: 9-5 access. HTTP/Outlook traffic.
*   **Printers**: Print jobs. SNMP.

### Deviation
1.  **Volume**: User downloads 50GB. (Data Theft?).
2.  **Port**: Web Server tries to SSH out to the internet. (Reverse Shell).
3.  **Time**: CEO logs in at 3am on Sunday. (Compromised Credential).

## 3. Guided Practice

### Spot the Anomaly
**Baseline**:
HR File Server usually sends 10MB/day to the Backup Server.
HR Users usually read 5MB/day from HR File Server.

**Event**:
HR User "Bob" reads 5GB from HR File Server.
Then sends 5GB to an unknown IP in Brazil.

**Verdict**:
*   Deviation 1: Bob read 1000x normal data. (Staging).
*   Deviation 2: Bob sent data to a non-business IP. (Exfiltration).

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Dynamic IPs**: How do you baseline a DHCP network? (Focus on User Identities or Asset Integrations, not just IPs).
2.  **Seasonality**: Is a spike on "Black Friday" an attack? (No, for retail. Context matters).
3.  **Learning**: How long does a tool need to learn the baseline? (Usually 2-4 weeks to understand weekly patterns).

---

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You understand that Security is "Context".
2.  You treat a Server initiating a connection to the Internet as suspicous.
3.  You know that "New" often means "Bad".
