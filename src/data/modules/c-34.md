# The Periodic Feedback Loop

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers **Agile Security**. Sprints, Retrospectives, and Iteration.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Security is a loop, not a destination.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **OODA Loop** (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act).
*   **Purple Team Sprints**.
*   **Retrospectives**.

## 2. Core Content

### The 2-Week Sprint
1.  **Plan**: Select 5 MITRE Techniques.
2.  **Build**: Write Red Scripts & Blue Rules.
3.  **Test**: Execute.
4.  **Review**: Did we catch them?
5.  **Deploy**: Push rules to Prod.

### The OODA Loop
Speed wins.
*   If the attacker's OODA loop is faster than yours, you lose.
*   *Goal*: Automate the "Orient" and "Decide" phases.

## 3. Guided Practice

### The Retrospective
**Meeting**: Friday 4pm.
**Question**: "Why did detection T1547 fail?"

*   *Fix*: Add agent check to the pre-flight checklist.

**Action**: Implement the fix immediately.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Blame**: Retrospectives must be **Blameless**. "The process failed," not "Bob failed."
2.  **Actionable**: Don't just complain. Create a Jira ticket.
3.  **Continuous**: Do this forever.

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You run notional **Sprints**.
2.  You conduct **Blameless Post-Mortems**.
3.  You use the **OODA Loop** to speed up decision making.
