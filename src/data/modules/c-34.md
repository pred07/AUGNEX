# Control Maturity and Gaps

## 1. What this module covers
Rating your controls on a scale, not just Yes/No. CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) for Cyber.

## 2. Why this matters for purple teams
"We have AV" is not enough. Is it Optimized? Managed? Ad-hoc?

## 3. Core concepts explained clearly

### Maturity Levels (1-5)
1.  **Initial**: Ad-hoc. "We install AV when we remember."
2.  **Managed**: Standard policy. "All PCs get AV."
3.  **Defined**: Documented process. "Alerts go to Ticket #."
4.  **Quantitatively Managed**: Metrics. "We block 99% of malware."
5.  **Optimizing**: Continuous improvement. "We tune AV daily."

## 4. Validation examples

### Assessing EDR Maturity
*   **Test**: Run a new malware variant.
*   **Result**: EDR missed it.
*   **Reaction**:
    *   *Level 1*: "Oh well."
    *   *Level 5*: "Why did we miss it? Let's analyze the signature, update the policy, and re-test across the fleet."

## 5. Common gaps and failures
*   **Regression**: Buying a Level 5 tool but operating it at Level 1 (Default settings, no monitoring).

## 6. Key takeaways
*   **People/Process/Technology**: Maturity looks at all three. Great Tech + Bad Process = Failure.
