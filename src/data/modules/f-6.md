# Virtual Networking Concepts

## Introduction

In a virtual lab, knowing how your VMs talk to each other (and the internet) is critical. If your Kali VM cannot see the target VM, you cannot attack it.

## The Three Modes

VirtualBox and VMware offer three main networking modes. You must know when to use each.

### 1. NAT (Network Address Translation)
*   **Behavior**: The VM shares the host's IP address to access the internet. It is protected from inbound connections.
*   **Analogy**: Like a device on your home Wi-Fi. It can go out, but the internet can't easily come in.
*   **Use Case**: Downloading tools, updating the OS (`apt update`).
*   **Default**: This is usually the default setting.

### 2. Bridged Adapter
*   **Behavior**: The VM connects directly to your physical network. It gets its own IP address from your router.
*   **Analogy**: Like plugging the VM directly into the wall ethernet port.
*   **Use Case**: When you want the VM to act like a separate physical device on your LAN (e.g., allow your phone to connect to a server hosted on the VM).
*   **Risk**: The VM is exposed to your local network.

### 3. Host-Only Adapter
*   **Behavior**: A private network between the Host (You) and the Guests (VMs). No internet access.
*   **Analogy**: A disconnected switch connecting only your laptop and the VMs.
*   **Use Case**: **Malware Analysis** and **Vulnerable Machines**. Isolate dangerous machines so they cannot call home or infect others.

## The Lab Standard

For most general practice:
*   **Kali**: NAT (Needs internet for tools).
*   **Target Machine**: Host-Only or NAT Network (Keep it safe).

## Verification

To check your IP address inside Linux:
```bash
ip addr
```
Look for `eth0`. If it says something like `10.0.2.15`, you are likely on NAT.
