# How Web Applications Are Built

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module deconstructs the target: The Modern Web App. Frontend, Backend, Database, and APIs.

### Fit in the Learning Path
You cannot hack a web app if you think it's just a "page". You need to understand the architecture to inject code into the right layer.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Frontend** (Client-side code).
*   **Backend** (Server-side logic).
*   **Database** (Storage).
*   **API** (The glue).

## 2. Core Content

### The 3-Tier Architecture
1.  **Presentation Tier (Frontend)**:
    *   HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React, Vue).
    *   *Attack Surface*: XSS (Cross Site Scripting), DOM manipulation.
    *   *Rule*: "Frontend security is no security" (Because the user controls it).

2.  **Logic Tier (Backend)**:
    *   Python (Django), Node.js, PHP, Java.
    *   *Attack Surface*: Auth bypass, Business Logic errors, RCE.

3.  **Data Tier (Database)**:
    *   SQL (MySQL, Postgres), NoSQL (Mongo).
    *   *Attack Surface*: SQL Injection.

### The communication
Frontend sends JSON to the Backend API. Backend queries DB. DB returns data. Backend processes it. Frontend renders it.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Architecture Analysis
Case Study: An Online Store.

1.  **User clicks "Buy"**:
    *   **Frontend**: Sends `POST /api/cart {item: "Watch", price: 100}`.
    *   *Attack*: Can I change `price: 100` to `price: 0`? (Tampering).

2.  **Backend receives request**:
    *   Checks if User is logged in.
    *   *Attack*: Can I remove the Session Token? (Broken Access Control).

3.  **Backend saves to DB**:
    *   `INSERT INTO orders...`
    *   *Attack*: Can I change "Watch" to "Watch'; DROP TABLE orders;--"? (SQLi).

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Trust**: Why should the Backend *never* trust the Frontend? (The Frontend is running on the Attacker's computer. They can change anything).
2.  **Complexity**: Why do Single Page Applications (SPAs) often leak more data than traditional apps? (They often send all data to the client and hide it with CSS, instead of filtering it at the server).
3.  **APIs**: Since modern apps use APIs, where is the logic? (Often shifted heavily to the client, creating logic gaps).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can explain the difference between Client-Side and Server-Side.
2.  You understand that HTML/JS validation is purely for "User Experience", not Security.
3.  You can diagram the flow of data from User to Database.
