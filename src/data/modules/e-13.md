# How Web Applications Are Built

## 1. Unit Brief: The Modern Stack
To break a web application, you must understand how it is assembled. Modern web apps are no longer just HTML files served by Apache. They are complex ecosystems of Load Balancers, Front-end Frameworks (React/Vue), APIs (REST/GraphQL), Microservices, and Databases.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Old School**: You attack `index.php`.
*   **Modern**: You attack the JSON API endpoint `/api/v1/user/update` that the React frontend calls in the background. If you don't know the difference, you are attacking the wrong target.

## 3. Core Concepts

### The Three-Tier Architecture
1.  **Frontend (Client-Side)**: What the user sees. Runs in the browser (HTML, CSS, JS).
    *   *Security implication*: Client-side validation is useless. I can bypass it with Burp Suite.
2.  **Backend (Server-Side)**: The logic. Runs on the server (Node.js, Python, Java).
    *   *Security implication*: This is where the trust issues happen.
3.  **Database (Persistence)**: Where data lives (SQL, MongoDB).
    *   *Security implication*: The "Crown Jewels" live here.

### Microservices
Instead of one big server ("Monolith"), apps are now split into tiny servers:
*   `auth.service` handles login.
*   `billing.service` handles money.
*   `user.service` handles profiles.
*   *Attack Vector*: If `auth.service` trusts `user.service` blindly, you can exploit that trust (SSRF).

## 4. Practical Examples

### Viewing the Stack
Open Chrome DevTools -> Network Tab. Reload the page.
*   You see a request to `GET /api/products`.
*   Response: `{"id": 1, "name": "Widget"}`.
*   **Analysis**: This is a Single Page Application (SPA) fetching data via REST API.

### Terminal Context: Identifying the Server
```bash
$ curl -I target.com
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.18.0
X-Powered-By: Express
```
*   **Interpretation**: An Nginx load balancer is sitting in front of a Node.js (Express) backend.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Attacking the Frontend**: Spending hours trying to "hack" the JavaScript that runs in *your own browser*. You need to attack the request sent to the *server*.
*   **Thinking HTML is secure**: HTML `type="hidden"` inputs are not hidden from a hacker. They are just text.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Client vs Server**: Know where the code is executing.
*   **The API is the Target**: In modern apps, the UI is just a pretty wrapper. The API does the work.
