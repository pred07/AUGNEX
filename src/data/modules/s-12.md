# Effective Documentation & Note Taking

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
Investigations can take weeks. If you don't document, you forget. If you don't document, it didn't happen in court. This module covers **Hunchly**, **Obsidian**, and **Case Management**.

### Learning Objectives
*   Automate capture with **Hunchly**.
*   Structure notes for easy retrieval.
*   Manage chain-of-custody for web evidence.

## 2. Core Content

### The Problem
Screenshots are easily faked. URLs can change or be deleted (The "404" problem).

### Tools
1.  **Hunchly:** Browser extension that records *everything* (HTML, Screenshots, Timestamps) automatically. It creates a local hash to prove non-tampering.
2.  **Obsidian/CherryTree:** Hierarchical note taking. Link entities (Person A -> linked to -> Company B).

### Methodology
*   **Timeline:** Chronological log of actions.
*   **Entities:** List of Persons, Places, Accounts.
*   **Analysis:** Your thoughts/hypotheses separate from facts.

## 3. Lab: Case File Setup

### Scenario
Start Case: "Operation Bluebird".

1.  **Start Hunchly:** Ensure dashboard is recording.
2.  **Visit:** Target profile on Twitter.
3.  **Note:** "Identified target handle @bluebird. 300 followers."
4.  **Delete:** Target deletes the tweet.
5.  **Recovery:** Open Hunchly dashboard. View "History". The tweet is preserved locally with a timestamp hash.

## 4. Reflection
1.  Why is an "Archive.org" link not always enough? (Archive.org honors `robots.txt` and takedown requests. Local evidence is yours).
2.  What is the "Bus Factor"? (If you get hit by a bus, can someone else pick up your investigation from your notes? If not, you failed).
