# Introduction to Computing Systems

## Introduction

In Phase 0, we looked at the valid "Mental Model" of a computer. Now, in Phase 2, we look at the **Engineering Reality**. To hack a system, you must understand exactly how it executes instructions.

## The Von Neumann Architecture

Almost all modern computers follow this design. It has three parts:

1.  **Input/Output (I/O)**: Keyboard, Mouse, Network Card, Screen.
2.  **Memory**: Where data and programs live temporarily while running.
3.  **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: The brain that fetches instructions from memory and executes them.

## The Boot Process (Simplified)

What happens when you press the power button?

1.  **BIOS/UEFI**: The motherboard firmware wakes up and checks hardware (POST).
2.  **Bootloader**: It looks for a boot device (Hard Drive/USB) and loads the Bootloader (GRUB on Linux, Windows Boot Manager).
3.  **Kernel**: The bootloader loads the OS Kernel into memory.
4.  **Init System**: The Kernel starts the first process (systemd on Linux), which launches everything else.

> **Why this matters**: Malware often hides in the Bootloader (Bootkits) or Kernel (Rootkits) to become invisible to the OS.

## Operating Systems

The OS is just a program. Its job is to manage hardware resources for other programs.
*   **Linux**: Open-source, runs the internet.
*   **Windows**: Closed-source, runs the enterprise.
*   **macOS**: Unix-based, runs the creatives.

## Conclusion

Understanding "INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT" is the basis of all exploitation. We exploit the "PROCESS" part by giving it unexpected "INPUT".
