# Introduction to Computing Systems

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module bridges the gap between "Hardware" and "Operating System." We explore the Von Neumann architecture, the boot process, and how a computer actually wakes up.

### Fit in the Learning Path
To understand "Persistence" (how malware survives a reboot), you must first understand the Boot Process.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   The **BIOS/UEFI** role.
*   The **Bootloader** (GRUB/Windows Boot Manager).
*   The **Kernel Initialization**.

## 2. Core Content

### The Boot Chain of Trust
When you press the power button, a relay race begins:

1.  **Power On**: Electricity stabilizes.
2.  **Firmware (UEFI/BIOS)**: The motherboard software wakes up. It checks hardware (POST) and looks for a Boot Device (Disk, USB).
3.  **Bootloader**: A small program (like GRUB) lives at the start of the disk. Its only job is to load the Kernel.
    *   *Attack Vector*: "Bootkits" infect this layer to load before the OS.
4.  **Kernel**: The OS Core loads into memory. It takes control of the hardware from the Firmware.
5.  **User Space (Init)**: The Kernel starts the first process (PID 1). In Linux, this is usually `systemd`. In Windows, `smss.exe`.

### Von Neumann Architecture
Ideally, a computer is simple:
*   **CPU**: Math brain.
*   **Memory (RAM)**: Fast, temporary, expensive storage.
*   **I/O**: Slow, permanent interaction (Disk, Keyboard, Network).
*   **Bus**: The highway connecting them.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Analyzing the Boot Process (Linux)
We will look at the logs of what happened when your VM woke up.

**Step 1: View Kernel Ring Buffer**
Run:
```bash
dmesg | less
```
*   **Navigation**: Use Arrow keys. Press `q` to quit.
*   **Observation**: You are seeing the Kernel discovering hardware. "Found CPU", "Mounting Root Filesystem", "Initializing Network".

**Step 2: Analyze Process #1**
Run:
```bash
ps -p 1 -o comm,args
```
*   **Output**: You should see `systemd` or `init`.
*   **Meaning**: This is the father of all processes. If this dies, the system crashes (Kernel Panic).

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Encryption**: If you encrypt your Hard Drive (BitLocker/LUKS), at which stage is the password asked? (Hint: Before the Kernel can read the disk).
2.  **Malware**: Why does sophisticated malware try to live in the Firmware (UEFI) rather than the Hard Drive?
3.  **Diagnostics**: If `dmesg` shows "I/O Error" on your disk, is that a software bug or physical damage?

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can list the order: Firmware -> Bootloader -> Kernel -> User Space.
2.  You have run `dmesg` and read the first 20 lines.
