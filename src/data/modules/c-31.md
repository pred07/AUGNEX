# Metrics That Matter

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers **MTTD**, **MTTR**, and **False Positive Rate**.

### Fit in the Learning Path
You can't manage what you don't measure. "We feel safer" is not a metric.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Mean Time To Detect (MTTD)**.
*   **Mean Time To Respond (MTTR)**.
*   **Dwell Time**.

## 2. Core Content

### The Big Two
1.  **MTTD**: How long does the attacker live in your network before an alert triggers? (Industry Avg: 200+ days. Goal: < 1 hour).
2.  **MTTR**: Once alerted, how long to kick them out? (Goal: < 4 hours).

### False Positives (The Silent Killer)
*   If you have 10,000 alerts and 9,999 are fake, your analysts will quit.
*   *Metric*: False Positive Rate (FPR). Goal: < 5% per rule.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Calculating ROI
**Scenario**: You bought a $50k EDR tool.
**Before**: MTTD = 5 days.
**After**: MTTD = 1 hour.
**Value**: The drill-down time saved x Analyst Rate = Savings.

### Tuning the Noise
**Action**: Identify the "Noisiest Rule" in the SIEM.
**Task**: Tune it. Add an exception for the backup server.
**Result**: Alert volume drops by 20%.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Gaming the stats**: Closing tickets without investigating "to improve MTTR" is dangerous.
2.  **Context**: Fast response is bad if it's the *wrong* response. Accuracy matters.
3.  **Trend**: Is the line going down? That's all that matters.

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can define **MTTD** and **MTTR**.
2.  You track **False Positive Rates**.
3.  You focus on **Trends** over snapshots.
