# Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)

## 1. What this module covers
The speedometer of the SOC. How long does the attacker live in your network before you see them?

## 2. Why this matters for purple teams
If your MTTD is 30 days, the attacker has already won. Purple Teaming drives MTTD down.

## 3. Core concepts explained clearly

### Definition
*   **Start**: Time the red team executes the technique (T0).
*   **End**: Time the analyst creates the ticket (T1).
*   **MTTD = T1 - T0**.

### Industry Averages
*   Global Average: ~200 Days (Terrifying).
*   Goal: < 1 Hour.

## 4. Validation examples

### The Race
1.  **Red**: Execute "Kerberoasting" at 10:00 AM.
2.  **Blue**: Alert fires at 10:05 AM. Analyst opens ticket at 10:15 AM.
3.  **MTTD**: 15 Minutes. (Excellent).
4.  **Red**: Execute "Silver Ticket" at 10:30 AM.
5.  **Blue**: No alert.
6.  **MTTD**: Infinite. (Failure).

## 5. Common gaps and failures
*   **Alert volume**: If an alert sits in the "To Do" queue for 3 days, your MTTD is 3 days. Triage speed matters.

## 6. Key takeaways
*   **Automation**: The only way to lower MTTD significantly is automation (SOAR).
