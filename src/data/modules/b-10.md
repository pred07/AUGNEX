# Virtualization Fundamentals

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
Virtualization is the creation of a virtual version of something, such as an operating system, a server, a storage device, or network resources. For security professionals, it is the bedrock of safe testing, malware analysis, and scalable infrastructure. This module explores the architecture of virtualization, distinguishing it from containerization, and establishing the importance of isolation.

### Learning Objectives
*   Differentiate between Physical HW, Host OS, and Guest OS.
*   Understand the Concept of "Abstraction Layer."
*   Compare Virtual Machines (VMs) vs. Containers (Docker).
*   Master the utility of Snapshots for reversible engineering.

## 2. Core Content

### Architecture of a VM
A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software computer that, like a physical computer, runs an operating system and applications. The **Hypervisor** sits between the hardware and the virtual environment.

### VMs vs. Containers
*   **VMs:** Virtualize the *Hardward*. Each VM has a full OS kernel. heavy, secure isolation.
*   **Containers:** Virtualize the *Operating System*. Containers share the host kernel. Lightweight, fast, but weaker isolation (Kernel exploits affect all).

### The Security Sandbox
Virtualization provides a "Sandbox"—an isolated environment. If you detonate malware in a VM, your Host OS (and personal data) remains safe. 
*   **Warning:** Advanced malware can detect it is in a VM ("Anti-VM" techniques) or even escape it ("VM Escape" vulnerabilities).

### Snapshots
The single most critical feature for experimentation. A snapshot records the state of a VM at a specific point in time.
*   **Workflow:** Clean State -> Snapshot -> Infect with Malware -> Analyze -> Revert to Clean State.

## 3. Lab: Visualizing Isolation

### Task
1.  Open Task Manager (Windows) or `top` (Linux) on your Host.
2.  Start a VM (e.g., Kali Linux).
3.  Run a high-load process in the VM (e.g., `yes > /dev/null`).
4.  **Observe:** Your Host sees a single process (the Hypervisor) consuming CPU, but cannot see the internal processes of the VM.

## 4. Reflection
1.  Why is a VM better than a Container for analyzing a Windows Virus?
2.  If you share a folder between Host and Guest, have you broken the sandbox? (Yes. Ransomware can encrypt shared folders).
