# Penetration Testing Methodologies (PTES, OWASP, NIST)

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module introduces the standard playbooks used by professionals. We don't just "hack random things"; we follow a scientific process.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Methodology ensures consistency. It ensures you don't miss the obvious open door because you were too busy picking the lock on the window.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **PTES** (Penetration Testing Execution Standard).
*   **OWASP** (Open Web Application Security Project).
*   **NIST** (National Institute of Standards and Technology).

## 2. Core Content

### The PTES Lifecycle
The industry standard flow:
1.  **Pre-engagement Interactions**: Contracts, Scope.
2.  **Intelligence Gathering**: OSINT, Recon.
3.  **Threat Modeling**: "How would I break this?"
4.  **Vulnerability Analysis**: Finding the holes.
5.  **Exploitation**: Entering the holes.
6.  **Post Exploitation**: "What can I do now that I'm inside?"
7.  **Reporting**: Writing it down.

### OWASP (The Web Bible)
*   **OWASP Top 10**: The list of most critical web risks (Injection, Broken Auth, etc.).
*   **WSTG**: Web Security Testing Guide. A checklist of what to test on a website.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Mapping Concepts
Match the Action to the PTES Phase.

**Action 1**: Browsing the CEO's LinkedIn to guess their password.
*   **Phase**: Intelligence Gathering.

**Action 2**: Running `hydra` to crack a login.
*   **Phase**: Exploitation.

**Action 3**: Dumping the database password hashes after getting a shell.
*   **Phase**: Post-Exploitation.

**Action 4**: Explaining the risk to the CISO.
*   **Phase**: Reporting.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Checklists**: Why do senior pentesters still use checklists (like OWASP WSTG)? (Memory is fallible. Checklists ensure complete coverage).
2.  **Rigidity**: Should you follow the methodology blindly? (No. It's a guide, not a robot script. Creativity is needed during Exploitation).
3.  **Client**: Does the client care more about the Exploitation or the Reporting? (Reporting. That's the product they bought).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can recite the 7 phases of PTES.
2.  You know that OWASP controls Web Security.
3.  You understand that **Reporting** is just as important as Hacking.
