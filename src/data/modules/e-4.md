# Penetration Testing Methodologies (PTES, OWASP, NIST)

## 1. Unit Brief: Standardizing the Chaos
Professional hacking isn't random. It follows structured methodologies to ensure coverage, repeatability, and thoroughness. Following a standard ensures you don't miss obvious holes and allows clients to compare apples to apples.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
When a client asks, "What methodology do you follow?", saying "I just try stuff" will lose you the contract. You need to cite industry standards like PTES or OWASP.

## 3. Core Concepts

### PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)
The "Bible" of infrastructure pentesting. It defines 7 phases:
1.  **Pre-engagement Interactions**: Scope, ROE, payment.
2.  **Intelligence Gathering**: OSINT, identifying targets.
3.  **Threat Modeling**: Designing the attack plan.
4.  **Vulnerability Analysis**: Scanning, enumeration.
5.  **Exploitation**: Getting the shell/access.
6.  **Post-Exploitation**: Pivoting, looting, persistence.
7.  **Reporting**: Documentation and fixes.

### OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)
Specific to Web Apps.
*   **OWASP Top 10**: The ten most critical risks (Injection, Broken Auth, etc.).
*   **OWASP WSTG** (Web Security Testing Guide): A massive checklist of *everything* you should check in a web app.

### NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
Government/Formal standard (NIST 800-115). Focuses on Planning, Discovery, Attack, and Reporting. Often required for government contracts.

## 4. Practical Examples

### Scenario: The PTES Workflow

1.  **Intel**: You find an employee's LinkedIn profile mentioning they use "vOldSoftware v1.0".
2.  **Threat Model**: You hypothesize this software has a specific exploit.
3.  **Vuln Analysis**: You confirm the service is running on Port 8080.
4.  **Exploitation**: You run the exploit and get access.
5.  **Post-Exploit**: You dump the database passwords.

### Applying OWASP
When testing a login form:
1.  Check **Injection** (SQLi).
2.  Check **Broken Auth** (Brute force, credential stuffing).
3.  Check **Security Misconfig** (Default credentials).
You don't just "guess passwords" randomly; you follow the categories.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Skipping Post-Exploitation**: Getting a shell is cool, but business impact comes from what you do *after*. Can you read sensitive data?
*   **Tunnel Vision**: Focusing 100% on one difficult exploit and ignoring 10 simple misconfigurations that would have gotten you in faster.
*   **Ignoring Intel**: Trying to brute force a login when the password "Company2023!" was in a pastebin leak found during OSINT.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Methodology = Consistency**: Clients pay for a thorough check, not just a lucky break.
*   **PTES**: For general infrastructure/network.
*   **OWASP**: For web applications.
