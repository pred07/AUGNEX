# IP Addressing, Ports, and Protocols

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module is the "Address Book" of the internet. We define IPv4, IPv6, Subnets, and the critical concept of logical Ports.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Scanning a target (Nmap) is entirely based on finding open Ports on an IP address. This is the bread and butter of Reconnaissance.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **IPv4 Structure**: Octets and Ranges.
*   **Subnet Masks**: Defining the size of a network.
*   **Ports**: The doors to the house.

## 2. Core Content

### IP Addresses (The House Number)
*   **IPv4**: 32-bit. `192.168.1.1`.
*   **Private Ranges (RFC 1918)**: IPs that don't exist on the internet (only LAN).
    *   `192.168.x.x` (Home).
    *   `10.x.x.x` (Corporate).
    *   `172.16.x.x` (Corporate).

### Ports (The Doors)
An IP gets you to the computer. A Port gets you to the Application.
*   **Range**: 0 - 65535.
*   **Well-Known**:
    *   **21**: FTP
    *   **22**: SSH (Secure Shell)
    *   **80**: HTTP (Web)
    *   **443**: HTTPS (Secure Web)
    *   **3389**: RDP (Remote Desktop)

### Protocols (The Language)
*   **TCP**: Reliable. "Did you get that packet? No? resending." (Web, Email).
*   **UDP**: Fast/Unreliable. "Here is packet. Good luck." (Streaming, DNS).

## 3. Guided Practice

### Identifying Open Ports
We will see what "Doors" are open on your current machine.

**Step 1: Netstat**
Run this in Terminal or PowerShell:
```cmd
netstat -an
```
*   `-a`: All ports.
*   `-n`: Numeric (don't resolve names).

**Step 2: Analyze Listening Ports**
Look for lines that say `LISTENING`.
*   `0.0.0.0:135` -> Your computer is accepting connections on Port 135 (RPC).
*   `127.0.0.1:5173` -> If you are running the Augnex dev server, you see it here!

**Step 3: Connect to a Port**
Open a browser and type `http://localhost:5173`.
*   **Logic**: Browser (Client) -> Localhost (IP) -> Port 5173. The "Door" is open, so the app loads.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Firewalls**: What does a firewall actually do? (It blocks specific Ports from specific IPs).
2.  **Scanning**: If I knock on Port 22 and get a response, what do I know about the server? (It is likely a Linux/Unix server offering remote access).
3.  **Conflict**: Can two programs listen on Port 80 at the same time? (No. The OS forbids it).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You have run `netstat`.
2.  You can identify common ports (80, 443, 22).
3.  You understand the difference between a Public IP and a Private IP.
