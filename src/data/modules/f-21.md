# IP Addressing, Ports, and Protocols

## IP Addresses (Identity)

Every device on a network needs an address.
*   **IPv4**: `192.168.1.5` (Old, running out).
*   **IPv6**: `2001:0db8:...` (New, highly abundant).
*   **Local**: `127.0.0.1` (localhost). This is "You".

## Ports (Doors)

An IP address gets you to the house. A **Port** gets you to the specific room.
There are 65,535 ports.

*   **Port 80**: HTTP (Web)
*   **Port 443**: HTTPS (Secure Web)
*   **Port 22**: SSH (Remote Linux Control)
*   **Port 3389**: RDP (Remote Windows Control)

## TCP vs UDP

The Transport Layer protocols.

### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
*   **Concept**: Connection-oriented. "Reliable."
*   **Flow**:
    1.  Syn? "Hello?"
    2.  Syn-Ack! "Hello back!"
    3.  Ack. "Okay, we are connected." (The 3-Way Handshake).
*   **Use Case**: Web browsing, Emails, File transfers.

### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
*   **Concept**: Connectionless. "Fast."
*   **Flow**: "Here is data! catch it if you can!" No handshake.
*   **Use Case**: Video streaming, Gaming, DNS.

## Why This Matters

Nmap scans work by sending "Syn" packets to ports.
*   If the server replies "Syn-Ack", the port is **Open**.
*   If the server replies "Rst" (Reset), the port is **Closed**.
*   If the server sends nothing, the port is **Filtered** (Firewall).
