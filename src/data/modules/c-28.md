# Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) Overview

## 1. What this module covers
Tools that automate attacks at scale. Robots doing Red Teaming.

## 2. Why this matters for purple teams
Humans are slow and expensive. Robots are fast and cheap (after you buy the license). BAS allows "Continuous Verification".

## 3. Core concepts explained clearly

### The Agent Model
*   Install "Attacker Agent" on V-LAN 1.
*   Install "Target Agent" on V-LAN 2.
*   BAS instructs Attack Agent to send exploit to Target Agent.
*   **Result**: Did the Firewall block it? Did the IPS catch it?

### Limitation: The "Known"
*   BAS tools run *known* attacks from a library.
*   They are great for "Regression Testing" (Did we break the firewall config?).
*   They are poor for "Novel" attacks (Zero Days or Logic flaws).

## 4. Validation examples

### The Daily Test
*   **Schedule**: Every morning at 4 AM, run "Ransomware Simulation".
*   **Trend**: Use the BAS dashboard to see if your "Block Rate" is going up or down.
*   **Alert**: If Block Rate drops from 100% to 80% -> Incident!

## 5. Common gaps and failures
*   **Whitelisting BAS**: Security team whitelists the BAS agents to "make them work". Now you are testing nothing.
    *   *Rule*: BAS traffic must be treated exactly like real traffic.

## 6. Key takeaways
*   **Augmentation**: BAS does not replace a Red Team. It frees the Red Team to do cool stuff instead of boring "Firewall Validation".
