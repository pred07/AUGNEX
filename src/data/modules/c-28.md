# Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) Overview

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers **BAS Tools**. Robots that attack you 24/7. (Cymulate, AttackIQ, SafeBreach).

### Fit in the Learning Path
Manual Atomic testing scales linearly. BAS scales exponentially.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Continuous Validation**.
*   **Agents**.
*   **Cloud Validation**.

## 2. Core Content

### How BAS works
1.  **Install Agent**: Put a BAS agent on a VLAN.
2.  **Simulate**: Agent A attacks Agent B.
    *   *Example*: Agent A sends ransomware file to Agent B via Email.
3.  **Measure**: Did the Email Gateway block it? Did Agent B's AV block it?
4.  **Report**: "Email Gateway failed. Endpoint blocked."

### Advantages
*   **Safety**: The attack stays between the two agents.
*   **Consistency**: Runs every hour. Alerts you if a config change breaks security.

## 3. Guided Practice

### The "WAF" Test
**Scenario**: BAS tests WAF.
1.  BAS Cloud sends 10,000 SQL Injection payloads to your Public Web Server.
2.  Simulates `id=' OR 1=1`.
3.  **Result**: 9,000 blocked. 1,000 passed.
4.  **Action**: Tune WAF to catch the 1,000.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Cost**: BAS tools are expensive enterprise software. (Atomic Red Team is the free alternative).
2.  **Agent Fatigue**: Yet another agent on the endpoint? (Yes. But valuable).
3.  **Realism**: Is it real? (It's a "Simulation". It mimics the traffic, but lacks the human intuition of a Red Teamer).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You understand the difference between **Pen Testing** (Point in time) and **BAS** (Continuous).
2.  You see value in **Regression Testing** security controls.
3.  You accept that **Security is a State, not a Status**.
