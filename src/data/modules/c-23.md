# Network Telemetry for Attack Validation

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers validating **Network Taps** and **Flow Data**.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Can you see the Command and Control (C2) channel?

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Beacon Analysis**.
*   **JA3 Fingerprinting** (SSL Client Hello).
*   **RITA**.

---

## 2. Core Content

### JA3
Hashing the SSL Handshake parameters.
*   A "Python Script" handshake looks different from "Chrome Browser".
*   *Test*: Run a python C2 script.
*   *Verify*: Does the JA3 hash match known malice?

### Flow Analysis
Exfiltration simulations.
*   *Test*: Upload 1GB to Dropbox.
*   *Alert*: "Large Outbound Transfer".

## 3. Guided Practice

### Simulation: C2 over DNS
**Action**: Use `dnscat2` (Simulation tool).
**Traffic**: Thousands of TXT records.

**Validation**:
*   Check Passive DNS logs.
*   Do you see the volume spike?
*   Do you see the long query length?

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Encryption**: Does JA3 work on encrypted traffic? (Yes! It fingerprints the *handshake*, which is cleartext).
2.  **VPN**: If user is on VPN, do we see the traffic? (Only if you split-tunnel or backhaul traffic).
3.  **Cloud**: VPC Flow Logs are the cloud equivalent. Use them.

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can explain **JA3**.
2.  You validate **Data Exfiltration** controls.
3.  You ensure you have visibility into **Encrypted Handshakes**.
