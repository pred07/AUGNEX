# Snapshots, Rollbacks, and Lab Hygiene

## Introduction

In cybersecurity, we break things. We accidentally delete system files, we run malware that encrypts disks, and we misconfigure servers. In a physical lab, this is a disaster. In a virtual lab, it is a 5-second fix.

## What is a Snapshot?

A **Snapshot** preserves the state of a virtual machine at a specific point in time. It saves:
1.  Disk contents.
2.  Memory state.
3.  Settings.

## The Golden Rule of Labs

**"Always Snapshot a clean install."**

Before you run a single command on your fresh Kali or Parrot install:
1.  Shut it down or pause it.
2.  Take a Snapshot.
3.  Name it: `Clean Install - [Date]`.

## Lab Hygiene Best Practices

### 1. The "Before Attack" Snapshot
Before running a dangerous exploit or downloading malware samples, take a snapshot named `Before Malware` or `Pre-Exploit`. If the machine gets bricked, you revert.

### 2. Isolate Dangerous VMs
Never connect a vulnerable target machine (like Metasploitable or a Windows XP target) to the internet (NAT/Bridged). Always use **Host-Only** networks to prevent them from being attacked by real bots on the internet.

### 3. Update Regularly
Update your attack machine (Kali) regularly, but **Snapshot before updating**. Sometimes an update breaks a tool you need.

## How to Revert

If you break your VM:
1.  Click the "Snapshots" tab in VirtualBox/VMware.
2.  Select `Clean Install`.
3.  Click **Restore**.
4.  You are back in business instantly.

## Conclusion of Phase 1

You now have a virtualization platform, a choice of two attack operating systems, a mental model of networking, and a safety net.

**You are ready to enter the Operating System.**
