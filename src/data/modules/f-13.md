# Linux Architecture (High-Level)

## Introduction

Linux is not just one operating system; it is a family of operating systems based on the Linux Kernel. We call them **Distributions** (Distros).

## The Components

1.  **Hardware**: The metal.
2.  **Kernel**: The core. It talks to hardware.
3.  **Shell**: The interface. It takes your commands and sends them to the kernel.
4.  **Applications**: Tools like Firefox, Nmap, Metasploit.

## The File System Hierarchy Standard (FHS)

Linux is organized as a single tree.

*   `/` (**Root**): The beginning of everything.
*   `/bin` & `/sbin`: Binaries (programs). `ls`, `cp`, `ip` live here.
*   `/home`: User data. e.g., `/home/student`.
*   `/root`: The home directory for the Admin. (Think of it as the penthouse).
*   `/etc`: Configuration files. (The "Settings" folder).
*   `/var`: Variable data. Logs (`/var/log`) and websites (`/var/www`) live here.
*   `/tmp`: Temporary files. Deleted on reboot.

## How Permissions Work (Recap)

*   **Read (r)**: 4
*   **Write (w)**: 2
*   **Execute (x)**: 1

If you see `chmod 777 file`, it means `4+2+1` (Read+Write+Execute) for Everyone.
> **Security Warning**: `777` permissions are usually a massive security hole.

## Why This Matters

When we hack a machine, we need to know where to look.
*   Where are the passwords? (`/etc/shadow`)
*   Where are the logs? (`/var/log`)
*   Where can I write my malware? (`/tmp` or `/dev/shm`)
