# Linux Architecture (High-Level)

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module deconstructs the Linux operating system into its core components: The Kernel, The Shell, and the Userland utilities.

### Fit in the Learning Path
You will spend 90% of your career in a Linux terminal. We move from theory to the specific architecture of the tool you will use every day.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   The Monolithic Kernel design.
*   The role of the **Shell** as an interpreter.
*   Why "Everything is a file" in Linux.

## 2. Core Content

### The Layers of Linux
1.  **Hardware**: The metal (CPU / RAM).
2.  **Kernel**: The core driver. In Linux, it's Monolithic (contains drivers for FS, Net, USB).
3.  **Shell**: The Command Line Interface (CLI). It accepts text and translates it to System Calls.
4.  **Userland**: The apps (`grep`, `cat`, `ls`, `python`).

### Philosophy: "Everything is a File"
This is the most powerful concept in Linux.
*   Your hard drive is a file (`/dev/sda`).
*   Your mouse is a file (`/dev/input/mouse0`).
*   Your running process is a folder of files (`/proc/1234`).
*   **Implication**: If you can read/write files, you can control hardware and processes using the same tools.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Exploring /proc (The Kernel's Brain)
The `/proc` directory is a "Virtual Filesystem". It doesn't exist on the hard drive; it is a direct window into the Kernel's memory.

**Step 1: Read CPU Info**
Instead of a fancy GUI, we just read a file.
```bash
cat /proc/cpuinfo
```

**Step 2: Read RAM Info**
```bash
cat /proc/meminfo
```

**Step 3: Finding the Kernel Version**
```bash
cat /proc/version
```

**Analysis**:
You just gathered system intelligence using only the `cat` command. This is why Linux is scriptable.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Modular vs Monolithic**: Windows uses a Hybrid kernel; Linux uses Monolithic. Does this make Linux faster or more prone to crashing if a driver fails? (Hint: Historically, more prone to crashes, but faster).
2.  **The Shell**: Is Bash the same thing as Linux? (No, Bash is just an app. You can uninstall it and still boot Linux).
3.  **Security**: If "Everything is a file", what happens if permissions on `/dev/sda` are set to `777` (World Writeable)? (Disaster).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You have navigated to `/proc`.
2.  You have read `cpuinfo` and `meminfo`.
3.  You can explain that the Shell is just a Userland application, not the Kernel itself.
