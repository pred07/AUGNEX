# Rule-Based vs Behavioral Detection

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module compares **Static Rules** vs **Dynamic Behavior**.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Static rules are fast but brittle. Behavior is robust but expensive. You need both.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **IOCs (Static)**: Hashes, IPs, Strings.
*   **IOAs (Behavior)**: Indicators of Attack. Techniques.
*   **UEBA** (User and Entity Behavior Analytics).

## 2. Core Content

### Rule-Based (Static)
"If X, then Alert."
*   *Example*: `Hash == <WannaCry>`.
*   *Pros*: Fast, definitive.
*   *Cons*: Zero-days effortlessly bypass it.

### Behavioral (Dynamic)
"If X acts weird, then Alert."
*   *Example*: "A user from HR opened PowerShell and connected to an IP in Ukraine."
*   *Pros*: Catches unknown threats.
*   *Cons*: High False Positive rate (Maybe HR is working remotely?).

## 3. Guided Practice

### The Ransomware Defense
**Static Layer**:
Block known Ransomware Extensions (`.crypt`, `.locky`).
*   *Attacker*: Renames files to `.txt.enc`. (Bypassed).

**Behavioral Layer**:
Alert if "Process modifies 100 files in 1 second" (Mass Write).
*   *Attacker*: Slows down encryption.
*   *Defender*: Alert on "Deletion of Shadow Copies" (`vssadmin delete shadows`). (High fidelity behavior).

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Baselining**: Behavior requires a baseline. "What is normal?"
2.  **Tuning**: Behavioral rules take longer to tune.
3.  **Pyramid**: This maps back to the Pyramid of Pain. Rules target the bottom (Hash). Behavior targets the top (TTPs).

---

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You prioritize **IOAs** over **IOCs**.
2.  You understand that Behavior detection requires **Context**.
3.  You use Static rules for **Quick Wins**, Behavior for **Long Term Safety**.
