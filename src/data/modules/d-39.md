# System Hardening Fundamentals

## 1. Unit Brief: Reducing the Surface
Hardening is the process of securing a system by reducing its "Attack Surface". Remove what you don't need. Lock down what you do need.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Unhardened**: Windows Server with default passwords, Guest account enabled, SMBv1 on. (Hacked in 5 mins).
*   **Hardened**: Windows Server Core (No GUI), patched, blocked ports, strong policies. (Hard target).

## 3. Core Concepts

### Least Privilege
*   Users should not be Admins.
*   Services should not run as Root.

### Application Whitelisting (AppLocker)
*   Only allow programs signed by "Microsoft" or "Our Company" to run.
*   Stops 99% of malware (which is unsigned).

### Removal
*   Uninstall Flash Player.
*   Disable Print Spooler (PrintNightmare) on servers that don't print.
*   Closing ports.

## 4. Practical Examples

### CIS Benchmarks
The industry standard "Checklist" for hardening.
*   **CIS Windows 10 Benchmark**: 300+ settings.
    *   "Ensure Password History is set to 24".
    *   "Ensure Guest Account is Disabled".

### Linux Hardening
*   **SSH**: `PermitRootLogin no`. Use Keys only.
*   **Kernel**: Disable USB module if not needed.
*   **Filesystem**: Mount `/tmp` as `noexec` (Cannot run scripts from Temp).

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Breaking the App**: Hardening too much breaks legacy applications. Test in Staging first!
*   **Drift**: You harden the server on Day 1. On Day 30, an admin changes a setting to "fix" something. Hardening degrades over time. Use Configuration Management (Ansible).

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Default is Insecure**: OS vendors prioritize "Usability". You must prioritize "Security".
*   **Benchmarks**: Don't guess. Use CIS or DISA STIGs.
