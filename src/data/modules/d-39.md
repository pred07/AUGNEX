# Zero Trust Deep Dive

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module formalizes **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)**. "Never Trust, Always Verify."

### Fit in the Learning Path
The perimeter is gone. Employees work from Starbucks. Servers run in AWS. Zero Trust is the only model that fits.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Identity** as the core.
*   **Continuous Authentication**.
*   **Micro-segmentation**.

## 2. Core Content

### The Principles (NIST 800-207)
1.  **All sources are untrusted**: Inside or Outside.
2.  **Least Privilege Access**: Just-in-Time access.
3.  **Inspect and Log everything**.

### How it works
User wants to access App.
1.  **Identity Check**: Is this Bob? (MFA).
2.  **Device Check**: Is Bob's laptop healthy? (Patch level).
3.  **Context Check**: Is Bob in a valid location?
4.  **Grant**: Access to *only* that App for *this session*.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Old vs New
**Scenario**: VPN.
*   **Old**: Connect VPN -> Full Network Access. (Flat).
*   **Zero Trust**: Authenticate -> Get access effectively to *nothing*. Request App A -> Policy Check -> Tunnel to App A *only*.

**Scenario**: Google BeyondCorp.
*   No VPNs. Every app faces the internet but is behind an Identity Aware Proxy.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Legacy**: Can you do Zero Trust on a 1990s Mainframe? (Hard. You need a Proxy in front of it).
2.  **User Experience**: Is Zero Trust annoying? (It can be. Frequent logins. SSO (Single Sign On) alleviates this).
3.  **Lateral Movement**: ZTA kills lateral movement. (If every hop requires auth, the hacker gets stuck).

---

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You define traffic based on **Identity**, not **IP**.
2.  You understand that Trust is **Dynamic** (can be revoked mid-session).
3.  You accept that the "Intranet" is an outdated concept.
