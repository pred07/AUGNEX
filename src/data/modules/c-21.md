# Using SIEMs for Validation (Conceptual)

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers how to use the **SIEM** as a testing ground, not just a passive receiver.

### Fit in the Learning Path
You wrote the rule. Now you must prove it works. The SIEM is your lab.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Replay Attacks**.
*   **Search effectiveness**.
*   **Dashboard Validation**.

## 2. Core Content

### The Loop
1.  **Inject**: Send a fake "Evil" log to the SIEM.
2.  **Verify**: Did the alert trigger?
3.  **Tweak**: If no, adjust the correlation logic.

### Historical Search
"Did we miss this in the past?"
*   *Action*: Take a new IOC (Hash) and search the last 30 days of logs.
*   *Result*: Retro-hunting.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Testing the "Impossible Travel" Rule
**Rule**: Alert if 2 logins from different countries < 1 hour.

**Test**:
1.  Send Log A: `User=Test, IP=US, Time=12:00`.
2.  Send Log B: `User=Test, IP=China, Time=12:05`.

**Expectation**:
*   Alert fires.
*   If not, check time zone settings (Common failure point!).

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Latency**: If the alert fires 4 hours late, is it a pass? (No. It's a failure of MTTR).
2.  **Indexing**: If you add a new field today, can you search it in old logs? (Usually no. SIEMs index on write).
3.  **Cost**: Don't flood the SIEM with test data unless you want a bill. Use a dev index.

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can manually inject a log.
2.  You treat the SIEM as an **Active Participant** in testing.
3.  You validate **Timezones** in your logic.
