# Security Frameworks (NIST & ISO)

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers the "Common Language" of security: **NIST CSF**, **ISO 27001**, and **CIS Controls**.

### Fit in the Learning Path
You don't need to invent a security program. Smart people already did.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **NIST CSF (IPDRR)**.
*   **ISO 27001** (The Certification).
*   **CIS Top 18** (The Checklist).

## 2. Core Content

### NIST CSF (Cybersecurity Framework)
The Gold Standard for operations.
1.  **Identify**: Know what you have. (Asset Mgmt).
2.  **Protect**: Guard it. (Access Control).
3.  **Detect**: See the breach. (SIEM).
4.  **Respond**: Fight back. (IR).
5.  **Recover**: Restore. (Backups).

### CIS Controls
The tactical "To-Do" list.
*   Control 1: Inventory Hardware.
*   Control 2: Inventory Software.
*   *Insight*: If you can't do 1 & 2, don't worry about AI-based Threat Hunting.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Mapping a Gap Analysis
**Scenario**: You join a new company. They have nothing.
**Task**: Use CIS Controls.
1.  Do you have a list of laptops? (No. -> Fail Control 1).
2.  Do users have Admin rights? (Yes. -> Fail Control 4).

**Result**: A prioritized roadmap. "Fix Inventory first."

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Compliance vs Security**: Being ISO 27001 certified doesn't mean you are unhackable. It means you have a *process*.
2.  **Adaptability**: Don't blindly follow the framework. Adapt it to your size.
3.  **Executive Speak**: Executives love frameworks. It shows "Due Diligence."

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can recite the **5 Pillars of NIST CSF**.
2.  You understand the value of **CIS Controls** for prioritization.
3.  You can explain why **Frameworks** reduce legal liability.
