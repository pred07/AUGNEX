# Baselining Endpoint Activity

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers "Knowing your Host". What normally runs on this laptop?

### Fit in the Learning Path
Is `svchost.exe` malicious? It depends. Is it running from `C:\Windows\System32` (Normal) or `C:\Temp` (Evil)?

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Known Good Paths**.
*   **Signed Binaries**.
*   **Autoruns** (Startup items).

---

## 2. Core Content

### The "Known Good"
*   **System32**: Where Windows binaries live.
*   **Program Files**: Where Apps live.
*   **AppData / Temp**: Where Malware often hides (because User has write permission there).

### Digital Signatures
Right-click -> Properties -> Digital Signatures.
*   **Microsoft**: Trusted.
*   **Unsigned**: Suspicious.

### Autoruns
Programs that start at boot.
*   Registry: `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`.
*   Startup Folder.
*   Services.

## 3. Guided Practice

### The "Svchost" Hunt
`svchost.exe` (Service Host) runs many times.
**The Fake**:
*   Typos: `svhost.exe`, `scvhost.exe`.
*   Path: `C:\Users\Bob\svchost.exe` (EVIL).
*   Parent: `explorer.exe` (Suspicious. Real svchost is spawned by `services.exe`).

**Action**:
Check the Hash of the suspicious file on VirusTotal.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Masquerading**: Can malware name itself `chrome.exe`? (Yes. But it can't sign itself with Google's certificate easily).
2.  **Temp Folders**: Why execute from Temp? (Because standard users can't write to System32. Temp is the only writable place).
3.  **Persistence**: Why check Autoruns? (Malware wants to survive a reboot. It MUST leave a trace in an Autorun location).

---

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You check the **Path** of every suspicious process.
2.  You verify the **Digital Signature**.
3.  You treat anything running out of `AppData` with extreme suspicion.
