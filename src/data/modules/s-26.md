# Geopolitics & Cyber Threat Intelligence

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
Cyber operations do not happen in a vacuum; they instruments of national power. To understand *why* an APT is attacking, you must understand the geopolitical goals of their sponsor. This module covers the "Big Four" (Russia, China, Iran, North Korea) and their strategic motivations.

### Learning Objectives
*   Map APT activities to national strategies (e.g., Belt and Road Initiative).
*   Differentiate between Espionage (China), Disruption (Russia), and Financial Theft (North Korea).
*   Analyze how kinetic wars (e.g., Ukraine) manifest in cyberspace.

### The "Big Four" Profiles

| Nation | Motivation | Targets | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **China** | Economic Espionage, IP Theft, Surveillance | Tech Companies, Defense Contractors, Dissidents | APT10, APT41, Hafnium |
| **Russia** | Disruption, Destabilization, Information Warfare | Critical Infrastructure, Elections, Ukraine | Sandworm (Voodoo Bear), APT28 (Fancy Bear) |
| **Iran** | Retaliation, Regional Power Projection | Oil & Gas, US Government, Israel | APT33, Charming Kitten |
| **North Korea**| **Money** (Sanction Evasion), Regime Survival | Crypto Exchanges, Banks, Defense | Lazarus Group, APT38 |

### National Power Instruments (DIME)
Nations use Cyber as part of DIME:
*   **D**iplomatic
*   **I**nformation (Propaganda / Cyber Influence)
*   **M**ilitary (Cyber Sabotage)
*   **E**conomic (IP Theft / Sanctions)

### The Blurring Line
State actors often outsource work to criminals (Privateers). 
*   *Example:* Russia allowing ransomware gangs to operate freely as long as they don't target Russia. This provides the state with "Plausible Deniability."

## 3. Lab: Who Benefits?

### Scenario
A massive data breach occurs at a US-based fighter jet manufacturer. Terrabytes of CAD drawings are stolen, but no systems are destroyed.

**Analysis:**
1.  **Motivation:** Intellectual Property Theft. 
2.  **Beneficiary:** A nation seeking to modernize its air force without R&D costs.
3.  **Likely Actor:** China (Strategic Match). Russia would likely sabotage; North Korea would steal money. 

**Verdict:** Prioritize hunting for TTPs associated with Chinese espionage (e.g., DLL side-loading, web shells).

## 4. Reflection
1.  Why did North Korea hack a movie studio (Sony)? (To defend "Regime Priority"—an insult to the leader is a strategic attack).
2.  How does the "Belt and Road Initiative" influence Chinese cyber targets? (Countries accepting Chinese infrastructure loans often see increased cyber espionage in their ports and telecoms).
