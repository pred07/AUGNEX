# Atomic Testing Fundamentals

## 1. What this module covers
Small, discrete tests. "Unit Tests" for security. One technique, one test, one result.

## 2. Why this matters for purple teams
Complex Red Team operations are expensive. Atomic tests are cheap, fast, and repeatable.

## 3. Core concepts explained clearly

### Atomic Red Team (ART)
*   Open source library of tests mapped to MITRE ATT&CK.
*   Format: YAML.
*   **T1003 (Credential Dumping)**:
    *   Test 1: Dump with Mimikatz.
    *   Test 2: Dump with Task Manager.
    *   Test 3: Dump Registry Hives.

### Execution Frameworks
*   **Invoke-AtomicRedTeam**: PowerShell framework to run these tests automatically.

## 4. Validation examples

### Running an Atomic
1.  **Select**: T1033 (System Owner/User Discovery).
2.  **Command**: `whoami`.
3.  **Execution**: `Invoke-AtomicTest T1033`.
4.  **Result**: Script runs `whoami`.
5.  **Validation**: Did we see it? (Maybe too noisy to alert, but should be logged).
6.  **Cleanup**: Script removes any artifacts.

## 5. Common gaps and failures
*   **Running without checking**: Running 500 tests in 1 minute. The SOC sees a "Wall of Red". Meaningless. Run one, check one.
*   **Permissions**: Running tests as User when they require Admin. Test fails (False Negative) because of permissions, not detection.

## 6. Key takeaways
*   **Speed**: Faster feedback loop.
*   **Library**: Don't reinvent the wheel. Use existing atomics.
