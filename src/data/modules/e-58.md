# Proof-of-Concept Ethics

## 1. Unit Brief: Do No Harm
A Proof of Concept (PoC) proves the vulnerability exists. It does NOT need to destroy the system. If you drop the production database to "prove" you could, you will be sued, fired, and possibly arrested.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **RCE**: Run `hostname` or `whoami`. Do NOT run `rm -rf /`.
*   **SQLi**: Extract `version()`. Do NOT extract `users` table (unless asked).
*   **XSS**: Pop `alert(1)` or `alert(domain)`. Do NOT steal a real user's session.

## 3. Core Concepts

### The "Benign" Payload
A payload that proves execution without side effects.
*   **XSS**: `alert('XSS')`
*   **RCE**: `id`, `ipconfig`, `cat /etc/passwd` (Safe-ish reading).

### PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
If you see credit card numbers:
1.  **STOP**.
2.  Take a screenshot blocking out the numbers (redact).
3.  Report immediately.
4.  Do *not* download the whole database "for evidence".

## 4. Practical Examples

### Stored XSS Safety
*   **Unsafe**: `<script>while(1){alert(1)}</script>` (Infinite loop, crashes browser for every user).
*   **Safe**: `<script>console.log('PoC')</script>` (Only visible in developer tools).

### SQLi Safety
*   **Unsafe**: `DROP TABLE users`.
*   **Safe**: `SELECT 1,2,3`.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Over-exploitation**: "I hacked the CEO's email and sent a joke to everyone." -> You are fired. Accessing the email was enough. Sending it was a crime.
*   **Leaving data**: Creating `hacker.txt` on the User's desktop and forgetting to delete it.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Minimum Viable Proof**: Do the absolute minimum to prove the risk.
*   **Data Privacy**: You are trusted with secrets. Keep them secret.
