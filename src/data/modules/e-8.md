# Active Reconnaissance Techniques

## 1. Unit Brief: Knocking on Doors
Active Reconnaissance involves directly interacting with the target system to force it to reveal information. This is where you start making noise. The goal is to identify open ports, running services, and operating system versions.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
Passive recon tells you *where* the target is. Active recon tells you *what* the target is running. You cannot exploit a Vulnerability in Apache 2.4.49 if you don't know they are running Apache 2.4.49.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Port Scanning
Sending packets to TCP/UDP ports to see how they respond.
*   **Open**: Accepting connections. (Attack surface).
*   **Closed**: Responding with "Go Away" (RST packet).
*   **Filtered**: No response (Firewall dropped it).

### Service Versioning (Banner Grabbing)
Connecting to an open port and listening for the "Welcome" message.
*   SSH often announces: `SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.2p1 Ubuntu-4ubuntu0.5`
*   This gives you: Protocol, Software Version, OS Version/Distro.

### OS Fingerprinting
Analyzing how the TCP stack responds to weird packets (TTL, Window Size) to guess the OS (Windows vs Linux).

## 4. Practical Examples

### The Nmap Scan
The standard for active recon.
```bash
$ nmap -sC -sV -p- 10.10.10.5
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp   open  ftp     vsftpd 2.3.4
80/tcp   open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.29
```

*   **-sC**: Run default scripts (safe enumeration).
*   **-sV**: Probe open ports to determine service/version.
*   **-p-**: Scan ALL 65535 ports (Default is only top 1000).

### Directory Busting (Web)
Using tools like `gobuster` or `ffuf` to brute-force URL paths.
*   `http://target.com/admin` (404 Not Found)
*   `http://target.com/login` (200 OK) -> Found!

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Scanning too fast**: `-T5` (Insane speed) usually results in inaccurate data and IP bans. Slow down (`-T3` or `-T4`).
*   **Scanning only Top 1000 Ports**: Critical services (like Admin panels) often hide on high ports (e.g., 8080, 8888, 10000).
*   **Trusting Defaults**: If Port 22 is open, don't assume it's SSH. It could be HTTP running on a weird port. Use `-sV`.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Interact with Intent**: Know why you are forcing a response.
*   **Nmap is King**: Master this tool. It is your eyes.
*   **Version Numbers Matter**: Specific versions have specific exploits.
