# Vulnerability Chaining in Web Applications

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers the "Combo Breaker". Mixing low-severity bugs to create a critical exploit.

### Fit in the Learning Path
A single bug is rarely enough. Real hacking is: Information Leak -> Auth Bypass -> File Upload -> RCE.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **The Chain**: Step 1 + Step 2 = Profit.
*   **CSRF + Replay**.
*   **XSS + CSRF**.

## 2. Core Content

### The Philosophy
*   **Low + Low = Medium**.
*   **Medium + Medium = Critical**.

### Classic Chains
1.  **IDOR + Password Change**:
    *   Use IDOR to view Admin's Email.
    *   (Not enough).
    *   Use IDOR to reset Admin's Password. (Critical).

2.  **XSS + CSRF**:
    *   CSRF targets a form (e.g., Change Email) but requires a Token.
    *   XSS reads the Token.
    *   XSS submits the CSRF form with the stolen Token.

3.  **LFI + File Upload**:
    *   Upload harmless text file with PHP code inside. (Not exectuable).
    *   Use LFI to include that text file. (Now it executes).

## 3. Guided Practice

### Scenario Analysis
**Goal**: RCE on a server.

**Bug 1**: `phpinfo.php` is exposed. (Info Disclosure - Low).
*   *Value*: Tells us the temporary file path.

**Bug 2**: LFI in `?page=`. (High).
*   *Limitation*: No interesting files to read.

**The Chain**:
1.  Send a POST request with a file upload (shell code). PHP stores it in a temp file (`/tmp/phpAbc12`).
2.  `phpinfo` reveals the name `/tmp/phpAbc12`.
3.  Use LFI to include `/tmp/phpAbc12`.
4.  **RCE**.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Reporting**: Do you report the chain or the individual bugs? (Report the Chain as the Headline, but detail the individual bugs).
2.  **Patience**: Why is chaining hard? (It requires understanding the interplay between systems).
3.  **Real World**: Are 1-click RCEs common? (No. Most RCEs are chains).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You stop dismissing "Low" severity bugs.
2.  You look for relationships between vulnerabilities.
3.  You can diagram an XSS -> CSRF attack.
