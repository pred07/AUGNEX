# Vulnerability Chaining in Web Applications

## 1. Unit Brief: The Sum is Greater than the Parts
A single Low severity bug is annoying. Three Low severity bugs chained together can become Critical. Chaining is the art of combining small exploits to achieve a major impact (RCE/Data Breach).

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Bug 1 (Low)**: Info Disclosure (Leaking internal path).
*   **Bug 2 (Low)**: Self-XSS (JavaScript only runs on my own profile).
*   **Bug 3 (Med)**: CSRF (Forcing a user to update profile).
*   **Chain**: Use CSRF to force the Admin to update their profile with the Self-XSS payload. The XSS executes in Admin context (becoming Stored XSS). Use the XSS to read the source code via the Path Disclosure.

## 3. Core Concepts

### The Pivot
Using access from Exploit A to enable Exploit B.
*   **Auth Bypass -> SQLi**: You can't exploit the SQLi in the dashboard if you can't login. Bypass login first.
*   **LFI -> RCE**: You can read files (LFI). You read the Apache Config to find the logs. You poison the logs (RCE).

### Context Escalation
*   **Self-XSS + CSRF = Stored XSS**
*   **Open Redirect + OAuth Token Theft = Account Takeover**

## 4. Practical Examples

### Chain: IDOR + File Upload -> RCE
1.  **IDOR**: You can view other users' profile IDs.
2.  **File Upload**: You can upload a shell, but you don't know the upload folder name.
3.  **The Chain**: Use IDOR to read the profile of a user who *just* uploaded an image. The API returns the path `/uploads/user_55/image.jpg`.
4.  Now you know the path structure. Upload your shell and execute it at `/uploads/your_id/shell.php`.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Reporting bugs in isolation**: "I found CSRF" (Low). "I found Self-XSS" (Low).
*   **Giving Up**: "I have LFI but I can't find anything good." (Dig deeper! Look for SSH keys, logs, configs).

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Don't ignore Lows**: Keep them in your notebook. They might accept the key to a bigger door later.
*   **Think Impact**: How can I use this small bug to do something bigger?
