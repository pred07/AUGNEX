# Privacy & Compliance (GDPR/CCPA)

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers

*   **Right to serve Forgotten**.
*   **Data Subject Access Requests (DSAR)**.
*   **Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)**.

## 2. Core Content

### The Laws
*   **GDPR (EU)**: Opt-in. Massive fines (4% Global Revenue).
*   **CCPA (California)**: Opt-out. Right to know.

### Privacy by Design
Don't ask for the user's phone number if you don't need it.
*   *Minimization*: Collect only what is necessary.
*   *Purpose Limitation*: Don't use "Security 2FA phone numbers" for "Marketing SMS". (Facebook got fined for this).

## 3. Guided Practice

### The DSAR Drill
**Scenario**: User "Alice" writes: "Delete all my data."
**Operations**:
1.  Can you find Alice in the SQL DB? (Yes).
2.  Can you find her in the Backups? (Maybe).
3.  Can you find her in the logs? (Hard).
4.  Can you find her in the SaaS Marketing tool? (Manual work).

**Goal**: Automate this within 30 days.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Fines**: The cost of non-compliance is often higher than the cost of security.
2.  **Trust**: Privacy is a brand differentiator. (Apple vs Google).
3.  **Mapping**: You need a Data Map (RoPA - Record of Processing Activities).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can explain **DSAR**.
2.  You conduct a **PIA** on new features.
3.  You practice **Data Minimization**.
