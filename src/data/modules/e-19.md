# Directory and Endpoint Enumeration

## 1. Unit Brief: Finding the Hidden Rooms
Websites generally don't link to their admin panels, backup files, or configuration scripts. Directory Enumeration (Fuzzing) is the process of guessing these paths using massive wordlists.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **The Findings**: `/backup.zip`, `/admin.php`, `/.git`, `/server-status`.
*   **Impact**: These files, which serve no content to the user, often hand over the keys to the kingdom.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Wordlists
Files containing thousands of common directory names.
*   `common.txt`: admin, images, upload, mail.
*   `raft-large-directories.txt`: 60,000+ words.
*   **SecLists**: The gold standard repository of wordlists.

### Status Codes in Fuzzing
*   **200**: Found it!
*   **301**: Found it (Redirect).
*   **403**: Found it (But forbidden). This is INTEL. It exists!
*   **404**: Doesn't exist (Ignore).

### Recursive Scanning
If you find `/admin`, you must start a new scan for `/admin/users`, `/admin/config`, etc.

## 4. Practical Examples

### Using Gobuster
```bash
$ gobuster dir -u http://target.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
/index.php (Status: 200)
/images (Status: 301)
/admin (Status: 403)
/uploads (Status: 301)
```

### Tips for Success
1.  **Extensions**: Don't just scan for directories. Scan for files.
    *   `-x php,txt,zip,bak`
    *   Result: `config.php.bak` (Source code leak!).
2.  **User-Agent**: Some firewalls block the default "Gobuster" user agent. Change it to mimic Chrome.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Using huge wordlists on slow networks**: This takes forever. Start small (`common.txt`) then go big.
*   **Not checking extensions**: Finding `config` (Status 200) is rare. Finding `config.json` is common.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **The site is bigger than the sitemap**: Just because there is no link to it, doesn't mean it's not there.
*   **Fuzzing is noisy**: This generates thousands of 404 errors in the server logs.
