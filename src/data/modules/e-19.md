# Directory and Endpoint Enumeration

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module focuses on the tools and wordlists used to find hidden directories. We dive into **Gobuster**, **Dirbuster**, and **FFuF**.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Finding `/admin` often equals "Game Over". This is the brute-force phase of web recon.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Wordlists** (`Seclists`).
*   **Status Codes** filtering.
*   **Recursive Scanning**.

---

## 2. Core Content

### The Logic
`Tool` + `Target URL` + `Wordlist` = `Findings`.

### Tools
*   **Gobuster**: Fast (Go-based). CLI only.
*   **Dirbuster**: Legacy. Java GUI. Good for recursive scans.
*   **FFuF**: "Fuzz Faster U Fool". Modern, flexible web fuzzer.

### Wordlists (SecLists)
The quality of your scan depends on your dictionary.
*   `directory-list-2.3-medium.txt`: The standard.
*   `big.txt`: For overnight scans.
*   `raft-small-words.txt`: High quality, curated.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Using Gobuster
**Command**:
```bash
gobuster dir -u http://target.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```
*   `dir`: Directory mode.
*   `-u`: URL.
*   `-w`: Wordlist.

**Output Interpretation**:
*   `/images` (Status: 200) -> Boring.
*   `/index` (Status: 200) -> Boring.
*   `/config` (Status: 301) -> Interesting!
*   `/dashboard` (Status: 302 -> /login) -> Interesting!

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Extensions**: Should you just look for folders? What about files? (Use `-x php,txt,zip` to find `backup.zip`).
2.  **Rate Limiting**: If the server blocks you after 100 requests, how do you scan? (Slow down with `--delay`).
3.  **Recursive**: If you find `/admin`, what should you do next? (Scan `/admin/` to find `/admin/users`, `/admin/delete`).

---

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can construct a basic `gobuster` command.
2.  You understand the importance of choosing the right wordlist.
3.  You know how to look for file extensions (`-x`).
