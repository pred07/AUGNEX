# Deception Technology

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
Reverse the asymmetry. Make the attacker afraid to touch anything. Deception involves planting fake users, files, and systems (**Honeypots**) that trigger high-fidelity alerts when touched.

### Learning Objectives
*   Deploy **Honeytokens** (Fake AWS Keys, Canary Files).
*   Understand **Active Defense**.
*   Integrate Deception into the SIEM.

## 2. Core Content

### Types of Deception
1.  **Honeytoken (Credential):** A fake AWS Access Key left in a code repo. If anyone tries to use it -> Alert.
2.  **Honeyfile:** `Passwords.xls` on a desktop. If opened -> Alert.
3.  **Honeypot (System):** A fake SSH server. If logged into -> Alert.

### The Psychology
Deception increases the attacker's **Dwell Time** (waste their time) and forces them to move slower (fear of detection).

### CanaryTokens
A free tool (Thinkst Canary) to generate tokens.
*   *Web Bug:* A URL. If visited, you get an email with the IP/User Agent.
*   *DNS Token:* A hostname. If resolved, you get an alert.

## 3. Lab: The Canary in the Coal Mine

### Scenario
You want to detect if an attacker is browsing a File Share.

1.  **Create:** A folder `\\Share\Finance\Salaries`.
2.  **Plant:** A `Desktop.ini` file with a custom icon path pointing to a Canary DNS token.
3.  **Trigger:** When Windows Explorer renders the folder, it tries to fetch the icon. It resolves the DNS.
4.  **Alert:** "Someone browsed the Salaries folder from IP X."

## 4. Reflection
1.  What is the False Positive rate of a Honeytoken? (Near Zero. No legitimate user has a reason to use a fake AWS key found in a hidden folder).
2.  Can honeypots be dangerous? (Yes, if you fail to isolate them. An attacker could use a compromised honeypot as a jump box to attack real systems).
