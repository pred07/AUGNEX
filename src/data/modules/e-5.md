# Threat Modeling and Attack Surface Mapping

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module teaches you to think before you attack. **Threat Modeling** is the art of predicting where the system is likely to break. **Attack Surface Mapping** is defining the perimeter.

### Fit in the Learning Path
A skilled hacker spends 80% of their time planning and 20% executing. If you skip this, you act like a "Script Kiddie".

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   What constitutes an **Asset**.
*   How to draw a **Data Flow Diagram** (mental or physical).
*   The **STRIDE** model.

## 2. Core Content

### Attack Surface
The sum of all points where an attacker can try to enter data or extract data.
*   **Network**: Open ports (22, 80, 445).
*   **Software**: Web forms, API endpoints.
*   **Human**: Employees (Phishing targets).

### STRIDE (The Microsoft Model)
A mnemonic for finding threats:
*   **S**poofing: "Can I pretend to be you?"
*   **T**ampering: "Can I change the data?"
*   **R**epudiation: "Can I deny I did it?"
*   **I**nformation Disclosure: "Can I see secret data?"
*   **D**enial of Service: "Can I crash it?"
*   **E**levation of Privilege: "Can I become Admin?"

## 3. Guided Practice

### Modeling a Login Page
Imagine a simple Login Box. Apply STRIDE.

1.  **Spoofing**: Can I brute force the password?
2.  **Tampering**: Can I change the password reset token?
3.  **Information Disclosure**: Does the error message say "User not found" (Enumeration)?
4.  **DoS**: Can I lock the account by sending 100 wrong passwords?

### Observation Task
Go to `google.com` (Do not hack it). Just look.
*   **Attack Surface**: Search Bar (Input), Voice Search (Input), Login Button, Image Search.
*   Every input is a potential door.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Complexity**: Why is a complex system harder to secure than a simple one? (More Attack Surface).
2.  **Reduction**: As a defender, how do you fix it? (Reduce the Attack Surface. Close unused ports. Disable unused features).
3.  **Mindset**: "Think like an Attacker" implies looking for the *weakest link*, not the strongest wall.

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can define **STRIDE**.
2.  You can look at a webpage and mentally highlight the "Inputs".
3.  You understand that Enumeration > Exploitation.
