---

## 2. Core Content

### What is covered?
1.  **Forensics**: Paying for Mandiant/CrowdStrike.
2.  **Legal**: Paying for breach counsel.
3.  **Ransom**: Reimbursement (Sometimes).
4.  **Business Interruption**: Lost revenue while down.

### The Application
Applying for insurance is a security audit.
*   "Do you have MFA on all remote access?"
*   If you say Yes and lie -> **Claim Denied**.
*   If you say No -> **Coverage Denied**.

## 3. Guided Practice

### The "Act of War" Clause
**Scenario**: Nation State attacks you.
**Insurer**: "This was an act of war. We don't pay."
**Counter**: "We are a civilian target. Not war."
*   *Note*: This is legally complex (e.g., NotPetya lawsuit).

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Panel**: Insurers have pre-approved vendors (The Panel). If you want to use your own IR firm, negotiate that *before* the breach.
2.  **Notification**: You must notify the insurer *immediately*. Late notice = Denial.
3.  **Value**: Insurance provides access to experts you couldn't otherwise afford.
