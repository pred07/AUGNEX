# Filesystems and Permissions

## Introduction

Without a filesystem, your hard drive is just a bucket of magnetic zeros and ones. The **Filesystem** is the logic that organizes data into "files" and "folders".

## Common Filesystems

*   **NTFS**: New Technology File System. The standard for Windows. Supports large files and permissions (ACLs).
*   **FAT32**: Old, compatible everywhere (USB drives), but cannot store single files larger than 4GB.
*   **EXT4**: Fourth Extended Filesystem. The standard for Linux.

## The Tree Structure

*   **Windows**: Uses drive letters. `C:\`, `D:\`. Each partition is a root.
*   **Linux**: Uses a single rooted tree `/`. Everything is a subdirectory, even other hard drives!

## Permissions (The most important concept)

Every file has rules about who can touch it.

### Linux Model (rwx)
1.  **Read (r)**: View contents.
2.  **Write (w)**: Modify contents.
3.  **Execute (x)**: Run as a program.

These apply to three groups:
*   **Owner** (You)
*   **Group** (Your team)
*   **Others** (Everyone else)

> **Lab Command**:
> In Kali, run:
> ```bash
> ls -l /etc/passwd
> ```
> You will see something like `-rw-r--r--`. That means "Owner can Read/Write, everyone else can only Read".

## Why This Matters

90% of "Privilege Escalation" attacks happen because an administrator set the permissions wrong (e.g., letting "Others" write to a system file).
