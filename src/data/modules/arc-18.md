## 2. Core Content

### The First 24 Hours
*   **Golden Hour**: Control the narrative.
*   **Roles**:
    *   *Incident Commander*: Technical Lead.
    *   *Crisis Lead*: Communication/Business Lead.
    *   *Scribe*: Writes everything down (for legal).

### Legal Privilege
*   Involve Legal Counsel immediately.
*   Mark documents "Attorney-Client Privileged".
*   This prevents your incident report from being used against you in a lawsuit (in some jurisdictions).

## 3. Guided Practice

### The Press Release
**Scenario**: Data breach confirmed. 1M records lost.
**Drafting the Statement**:
*   *Bad*: "We take security seriously." (Cliche).
*   *Bad*: "It was a sophisticated actor." (Excuses).
*   *Good*: "We identified a breach. We have contained it. We are notifying users. Here is what we are doing to fix it."
*   *Authenticity*: Admit the mistake. Apologize.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Fatigue**: Commanders need sleep. Shift work is mandatory.
2.  **Decisions**: "Do we pay the ransom?" (A Board-level decision, not an IT decision).
3.  **Drills**: Use a Crisis Simulation company to stress test the Executives.

## 5. Completion Criteria

1.  You have a **Crisis Communication Plan**.
2.  You understand **Attorney-Client Privilege**.
3.  You have identified the **Crisis Team**.
