## 2. Core Content

### BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)
Executives read the first paragraph. Put the conclusion there.
*   *Bad:* "On Jan 1st we saw a log..." (Storytelling).
*   *Good:* "BLUF: We detected and blocked a ransomware attempt. No data was lost. Recommendation: Fast-track the MFA project."

### Estimative Language (Words of Estimative Probability - WEPs)
Never say "Will" or "Won't" unless you are God.
*   **Almost Certain:** 90-99%
*   **Likely:** 60-90%
*   **Roughly Even Chance:** 40-60%
*   **Unlikely:** 10-40%
*   *Why?* If you say "They will attack" and they don't, you lose trust. If you say "Likely", you are protected.

### The 1-Page Brief
*   **Headline:** Actionable Title.
*   **Key Judgments:** 3 bullet points summary.
*   **Context:** Why this matters.
*   **Outlook:** What comes next.
