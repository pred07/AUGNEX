# Estimative Language (WEPs)

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
Intelligence analysis deals with uncertainty. You rarely know facts 100%. To convey uncertainty accurately, we use **Words of Estimative Probability (WEPs)** standardizes by the Intelligence Community (IC).

### Learning Objectives
*   Avoid "Weasel Words" (maybe, possibly, could).
*   Map confidence levels to percentages.
*   Distinguish between **Confidence in Analysis** vs **Likelihood of Event**.

## 2. Core Content

### The Standard (Sherman Kent)

| Term | Probability |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Remote** | < 10% |
| **Unlikely** | 10 - 45% |
| **Roughly Even Chance** | 45 - 55% |
| **Likely / Probable** | 55 - 90% |
| **Almost Certain** | > 90% |

### Confidence Levels
This describes the *quality of your evidence*, not the likelihood.
*   **High Confidence:** Multiple corroborated sources, high-quality intel.
*   **Moderate Confidence:** Credible source, but uncorroborated.
*   **Low Confidence:** Questionable source, or conflicted reporting.

### Examples
*   *Bad:* "The attackers might attack on Friday."
*   *Good:* "It is **likely** (55-90%) the attackers will launch a ransomware campaign this weekend. We make this assessment with **High Confidence** based on intercepted chat logs."

## 3. Lab: Fixing Ambiguity

### Task
Clarify these statements:

1.  "We believe the malware comes from China."
    *   *Fix:* "We assess with **Moderate Confidence** that the malware originates from Chinese state actors."
2.  "There is a chance the server will crash."
    *   *Fix:* "It is **unlikely** (<20%) that the exploit will cause a system crash."

## 4. Reflection
1.  Why is "could" a dangerous word? (Everything *could* happen. "A meteor *could* hit the data center." It provides no value to the decision maker).
2.  Can you be "Almost Certain" with "Low Confidence"? (Yes. "It is almost certain the sun will rise, but I have low confidence because I am trapped in a windowless room").
