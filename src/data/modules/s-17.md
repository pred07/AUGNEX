# Malware Analysis for Intel Analysts

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
You are not a Reverse Engineer (RE). You are an Intel Analyst. You don't need to decompile Assembly to find the "Kill Switch." You need to run **Basic Static** and **Basic Dynamic** analysis to extract **IOCs** (C2s, Mutexes, User-Agents).

### Learning Objectives
*   Perform **Static Analysis** (Strings, PE Headers).
*   Perform **Dynamic Analysis** (Sandbox execution).
*   Extract **Config Data** safely.

## 2. Core Content

### Basic Static (Safe)
Looking at the file without running it.
*   **File Hashing:** Get the MD5/SHA256. Search VirusTotal.
*   **Strings:** `strings malware.exe`. Look for IPs, URLs, "Password", "User-Agent".
*   **PE Headers:** Import Table. (Does it import `InternetOpen`? It connects to the net. Does it import `CryptDecrypt`? It uses encryption).
*   **Tool:** PEStudio.

### Basic Dynamic (Sandbox)
Running it in a controlled environment.
*   **VM:** Windows VM with *Host-Only* networking (FAKE-NET).
*   **Tools:** Procmon (Process Monitor), Wireshark (Network), Regshot (Registry changes).
*   **Action:** Detonate. Watch Procmon. Did it create a file? Watch Wireshark. Did it beacon?

### The "Triage" Mindset
Stop when you have enough intel to block it.
*   Found the C2? **Stop.**
*   Found the Mutex? **Stop.**
*   Found the Persistence mechanism? **Stop.**
*   *Leave the deep debugging to the RE team.*

## 3. Lab: Triage a Sample
*Scenario:* `Invoice.exe`.
1.  **Strings:** Found `badsite.com/login.php`.
2.  **PEStudio:** Compiled yesterday. Imports `ShellExecute`.
3.  **Detonation:** `Procmon` shows it dropped `update.vbs` in Startup.
4.  **Intel:** Block `badsite.com`. Scan endpoints for `update.vbs`.

---

## 4. Completion Criteria
1.  **Explain** why you never analyze malware on a host machine.
2.  **Identify** what `strings` provides.
