# Campaign Timeline Analysis

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
Constructing a linear timeline of an intrusion to understand **Dwell Time**, **Lateral Movement Speed**, and **Breakout Time**.

### Learning Objectives
*   Calculate **Dwell Time** (Time from compromise to detection).
*   Analyze **Breakout Time** (Time to move laterally).
*   Build a **Super-Timeline**.

## 2. Core Content

### Key Metrics
1.  **Dwell Time:** "The attackers were inside for 200 days before we found them."
    *   *Goal:* Reduce this.
2.  **Breakout Time:** "Attackers took 1 hour to jump from Patient Zero to the Domain Controller."
    *   *Benchmark:* Russian APTs averages ~18 mins. eCrime averages ~9 hours.
    *   *Implication:* You must detect faster than the Breakout Time to contain the incident.

### Super-Timeline Creation
*   **Source:** Firewall logs, Windows Events, File timestamps ($MFT).
*   **Normalization:** Convert everything to UTC.
*   **Visualization:** "10:00: Phishing Email -> 10:05: Click -> 10:06: Beacon".

## 3. Lab: Reconstruction
**Data:**
*   File `bad.exe` created 09:00.
*   Login event 09:15.
*   Exfiltration spike 12:00.
*   Alert triggered 14:00.
**Analysis:**
*   Dwell Time: 5 hours (09:00 to 14:00).
*   Damage: Data exfilled *before* detection. Failure.

## 4. Completion Criteria
1.  **Define** "Breakout Time".
2.  **Explain** why UTC normalization is critical (Timezones confuse correlation).
