# MITRE ATT&CK Framework

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is the periodic table of hacker behavior. Unlike the Kill Chain (7 steps), ATT&CK allows for non-linear, granular descriptions of behavior (e.g., "T1059.001: PowerShell"). It is the global standard for CTI categorization.

### Learning Objectives
*   Distinguish between **Tactics** (Goal) and **Techniques** (Method).
*   Navigate the ATT&CK Matrix.
*   Use ATT&CK Navigator to visualize coverage.

## 2. Core Content

### Tactics vs Techniques
*   **Tactic (Why):** The adversary's tactical goal. (e.g., "Credential Access").
*   **Technique (How):** The specific way they achieve it. (e.g., "OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory").
*   **Procedures (Detailed How):** The exact tool/command used. (e.g., "Mimikatz sekurlsa::logonpasswords").

### The Matrix
14 Tactics (Columns). Hundreds of Techniques (Rows).
1.  Reconnaissance
2.  Resource Development
3.  Initial Access
4.  Execution
5.  Persistence
6.  Privilege Escalation
7.  Defense Evasion
8.  Credential Access
9.  Discovery
10. Lateral Movement
11. Collection
12. Command and Control
13. Exfiltration
14. Impact

### Using it for Defense
Do not try to "Block T1059". You can't block all Command and Scripting Interpreters. Instead, map your detection gaps. "We have good coverage for *Exfiltration* but zero coverage for *Discovery*."

## 3. Lab: Mapping to ATT&CK

### Task
Map the following behaviors to IDs:

1.  Attacker sends a Spearphishing Link. -> **T1566.002** (Phishing: Spearphishing Link).
2.  Attacker adds a registry key to auto-start. -> **T1547.001** (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys).
3.  Attacker deletes Volume Shadow Copies. -> **T1490** (Inhibit System Recovery).

## 4. Reflection
1.  Why is ATT&CK better than the Kill Chain for Red Teaming? (It describes *what to do* in detail, rather than just "Exploit").
2.  What is a "Sub-technique"? (e.g., Phishing is the technique. Spearphishing Attachment is the Sub-technique .001. It adds granularity).
