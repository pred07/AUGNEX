# OSINT Methodology & OPSEC

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the art of intelligence gathering from publicly available sources. It is not just "Googling." It is a structured, forensic process. This module establishes the **Process** and the **Safety** (OPSEC) required to investigate without being detected.

### Learning Objectives
*   Define the **OSINT Cycle** applied to cyber reconnaissance.
*   Configure a **Sock Puppet** (Fake Persona) securely.
*   Understand **Passive** vs **Active** Reconnaissance.

## 2. Core Content

### The Golden Rule: Passive vs Active
*   **Passive Recon:** You never touch the target's infrastructure. You look at cached data, public records, separate databases.
    *   *Risk:* Zero. The target does not know you are looking.
    *   *Examples:* Whois, Archive.org, Shodan (technically passive for you, active for Shodan).
*   **Active Recon:** You touch the target.
    *   *Risk:* High. You leave logs (IP address).
    *   *Examples:* Nmap scan, connecting to their website, DNS zone transfer attempts.

### OPSEC: The Sock Puppet
To do OSINT, you need a fake identity.
1.  **The Name:** Use a generator. Check availability.
2.  **The Image:** AI Generated face (ThisPersonDoesNotExist) - *Warning:* Look for artifacts (earrings, weird hair) that reveal AI usage.
3.  **The History:** A fake account created today is suspicious. "Age" your accounts. Post generic content.
4.  **The Comms:** Burner phone numbers (VoIP), ProtonMail.
5.  **The Connection:** **VPN** is mandatory. Tor is optional (depending on target).

### The Investigation Framework
1.  **Pivot:** Start with one datapoint (Email). Search it. Find a Username.
2.  **Pivot:** Search Username. Find a Forum Post.
3.  **Pivot:** Read Post. Find a Domain.
4.  **Verification:** Is this the *same* "DarkLord99" or a different person? (Cross-reference habits, writing style).

## 3. Lab: Establishing a Research Identity
*Concept only due to Terms of Service.*
1.  **Browser Isolation:** Use a separate browser profile or VM.
2.  **Extension Hygiene:** Install uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger. Remove unique extensions (Fingerprinting).
3.  **Search:** Run a "Ego search" on a dummy target.

## 4. Tools of the Trade (Overview)
*   **Frameworks:** OSINT Framework (Website), Bellingcat Guides.
*   **Data Aggregators:** IntelX, DeHashed.
*   **Visualization:** Maltego.

## 5. Completion Criteria
1.  **Explain** why you never use your LinkedIn account to view a Threat Actor's profile. (They get a notification: "Project10 User viewed your profile").
2.  **Differentiate** Passive vs Active recon.
