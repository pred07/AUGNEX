# OSINT Methodology & OPSEC

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is not just "Googling." It is a disciplined methodology of collection, processing, and analysis. This module covers the **Intelligence Cycle** applied to OSINT and, critically, **OPSEC** (Operations Security). If you research a threat actor without OPSEC, you become the target.

### Learning Objectives
*   Define the 5 phases of the OSINT lifecycle.
*   Configure a "Sock Puppet" (Research Identity) securely.
*   Understand "Browser Fingerprinting" and how to defeat it.
*   Differentiate between Passive and Active reconnaissance.

## 2. Core Content

### The Golden Rule of OSINT
**"Touch nothing unless you must. Burn everything when you are done."**

### OPSEC Levels
1.  **Level 1 (Basic):** VPN + Incognito Mode. (Insufficient for investigations).
2.  **Level 2 (Intermediate):** Dedicated VM + Commercial VPN + User-Agent Spoofing.
3.  **Level 3 (Advanced):** Cloud Desktop (VDI) + Residential Proxy + Burner Phone verification.

### Sock Puppets
A Sock Puppet is a fake online persona used to observe targets without alerting them.
*   **Creation:** Never use your real email/phone. Use Mint Mobile/Burner app.
*   **Aging:** A 1-day old account is suspicious. Create accounts months in advance.
*   **Consistency:** A fake LinkedIn profile needs a seemingly real education history (that matches the age/location).

### Passive vs. Active Recon
*   **Passive:** Interacting with 3rd parties (Archive.org, Shodan, Whois). The target **never** sees your IP.
*   **Active:** Interacting with the target (Visiting their website, Port scanning). The target **sees** your IP in their logs.

## 3. Lab: The Clean Environment

### Scenario
Prepare a Browser profile for an investigation.

1.  **Install Firefox.** (Chrome leaks too much Google telemetry).
2.  **Extensions:**
    *   *uBlock Origin:* Block trackers.
    *   *User-Agent Switcher:* Pretend to be an iPhone or Windows PC.
    *   *Wappalyzer:* Identify technology stacks passively.
3.  **Check your Fingerprint:**
    *   Visit `amiunique.org` or `coveryourtracks.eff.org`.

## 4. Reflection
1.  Why is a "Residential Proxy" better than a Data Center VPN for investigating Facebook? (FB blocks Data Center IPs).
2.  If you accidentally click a "Like" button with your Sock Puppet, is the investigation burned? (Yes. Assume they saw it).
