# The Cyber Kill Chain

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
Developed by Lockheed Martin, the Cyber Kill Chain models the seven steps an adversary *must* complete to achieve their objective. It is a linear defense model: **Break any link in the chain, and you stop the attack.**

### Learning Objectives
*   Memorize the **7 Phases** of the Kill Chain.
*   Map defensive controls to specific phases.
*   Understand the limitations of the model (it assumes a perimeter).

## 2. Core Content

### The 7 Phases

1.  **Reconnaissance:** Researching the target (Harvesting emails, LinkedIn).
    *   *Defense:* Detection is hard. Alerts on "Dark Web" mentions.
2.  **Weaponization:** Coupling an exploit with a deliverable payload (Creating the PDF).
    *   *Defense:* N/A (Happens on attacker's machine).
3.  **Delivery:** Transmitting the weapon (Email Phishing, USB).
    *   *Defense:* Email Gateway, Spam filters.
4.  **Exploitation:** Triggering the code (Vulnerability triggered).
    *   *Defense:* Patching, DEP/ASLR, EDR.
5.  **Installation:** Installing the backdoor (Persistence).
    *   *Defense:* EDR, File Integrity Monitoring.
6.  **Command & Control (C2):** Communicating home.
    *   *Defense:* Firewall, DNS Filtering, Proxy logs.
7.  **Actions on Objectives:** Stealing data, Encrypting files.
    *   *Defense:* DLP, Network Segmentation, Backups.

### "Left of Boom"
Boom = The Compromise (Exploitation). Moving "Left of Boom" means detecting them at Recon/Delivery. Moving "Right of Boom" means Incident Response.

## 3. Lab: Breaking the Chain

### Scenario
An attacker sends a Phishing Email with a malicious Excel file. The user opens it. The Macro runs PowerShell. PowerShell downloads an EXE. The EXE encrypts the drive.

**Map the Interventions:**
1.  **Recon:** Attacker found user's email on website. (Defense: Remove email from public site).
2.  **Delivery:** Email arrives. (Defense: DMARC/SPF/DKIM check).
3.  **Exploitation:** Macro runs. (Defense: GPO "Block Macros from Internet").
4.  **C2:** Download EXE. (Defense: DNS Filter blocks evil.com).
5.  **Actions:** Encrypts drive. (Defense: Controlled Folder Access / Offline Backups).

If *any* of these succeed, the attack fails.

## 4. Reflection
1.  Why is the Kill Chain criticized for being "Perimeter Focused"? (It assumes the attacker is on the outside. It doesn't model Insider Threats well).
2.  Which phase allows the defender to detect the attacker *before* the malware lands? (Delivery - via email scanning).
