# Endpoint Security Fundamentals

## 1. Unit Brief: The Last Line of Defense
The network failed. The firewall failed. The malware is on the laptop. Endpoint Security is the battle for the OS.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Remote Work**: The "Network Perimeter" is dead. The laptop is at Starbucks. You cannot rely on the office firewall. The Endpoint protection MUST be strong.

## 3. Core Concepts

### The Stack
*   **EPP (Endpoint Protection Platform)**: Traditional Antivirus. Blocks known bad files.
*   **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)**: Records *activity*. "Process A spawned Process B".
*   **XDR (Extended)**: Correlates Endpoint + Network + Email.

### Hardening
*   **Disk Encryption (BitLocker)**: Protects data if laptop is stolen.
*   **Host Firewall**: Block inbound connections.
*   **Application Control**: Only allow signed binaries.

## 4. Practical Examples

### PowerShell Restriction
*   **Policy**: "Constrained Language Mode".
*   **Effect**: Prevents complex scripts (like tools used by hackers) from running, while allowing simple admin scripts.

### USB Blocking
*   **Policy**: "Deny Write access to Removable Media".
*   **Effect**: Employees cannot steal data by copying it to a USB drive.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Disabling AV**: "It slows down my compile time." Developers often disable security tools. This creates huge holes.
*   **Ignoring Linux**: "Linux doesn't get viruses." (False. Linux servers get web shells and crypto miners).

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **The Endpoint is the new Perimeter**: Treat every device as if it is on a hostile network (Zero Trust).
