# Endpoint Security Fundamentals

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers the **Endpoint** (Laptops, Servers, Phones). The final battlefield.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Encryption doesn't matter if the attacker controls the keyboard. The Endpoint is where the data lives and where the user clicks the phishing link.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **EPP** (Endpoint Protection Platform).
*   **Hardening** (Reducing surface).
*   **Whitelisting**.

## 2. Core Content

### The Hardened Image
Before installing tools, we secure the OS.
*   **Remove Bloatware**: Candy Crush shouldn't be on a corporate PC.
*   **Disable Unused Services**: Print Spooler? Xbox Live?
*   **Patching**: Automatic updates enabled.

### Application Control (The Silver Bullet)
**Whitelisting** (AppLocker): "Only run programs signed by Microsoft or Adobe."
*   *Effect*: Malware (`evil.exe`) cannot run because it's not on the list.
*   *Difficulty*: High maintenance.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Hardening Checklist
**Scenario**: You are deploying a new Windows Server.

1.  **Account**: Rename Administrator? Disable Guest? (Yes).
2.  **Network**: Enable Windows Firewall? (Yes).
3.  **Services**: Disable SMBv1? (Yes. It causes WannaCry).
4.  **Logging**: Enable PowerShell Script Block Logging? (Yes).

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Complexity**: Why don't we just whitelist everything? (Because users hate it. "I can't install Zoom!" leads to Shadow IT).
2.  **BYOD**: How do you secure a personal phone? (MDM - Mobile Device Management. Containerize the work data).
3.  **Physical**: If I steal the laptop, is the game over? (Not if BitLocker (Full Disk Encryption) is on).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You understand that **Hardening** happens *before* Detection.
2.  You treat **AppLocker** as the ultimate defense.
3.  You know that a "Default Install" of Windows is insecure.
