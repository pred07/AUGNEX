# Technology Stack Fingerprinting

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module answers: "What is this site built with?" Is it WordPress? React? PHP? Apache?

### Fit in the Learning Path
A PHP exploit won't work on a Java server. Fingerprinting saves you time by narrowing your attack arsenal to the relevant technology.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Wappalyzer**.
*   **Server Headers**.
*   **Tech-Specific files**.

## 2. Core Content

### Indicators
1.  **Response Headers**: `Server: Apache/2.4`, `X-Powered-By: PHP/7.4`.
2.  **File Extensions**: `.php`, `.jsp` (Java), `.asp` (Microsoft).
3.  **Cookie Names**: `PHPSESSID` (PHP), `JSESSIONID` (Java Tomcat), `connect.sid` (Node.js).
4.  **HTML Source**: Specific meta tags or folder structures (`wp-content` = WordPress).

### Wappalyzer
A browser extension that automates this. It detects 1000+ technologies instantly.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Identifying the Stack
**Observation Task**:
Look at a raw response:
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.18.0
X-Generator: Drupal 8
```

**Analysis**:
*   **OS**: Likely Linux (Nginx).
*   **Web Server**: Nginx.
*   **Framework**: Drupal 8. (CMS).
*   **Language**: PHP (Drupal is written in PHP).

**Action**:
Search for "Drupal 8 vulnerabilities" or "Nginx 1.18 exploits".

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Deception**: Can a server lie? (Yes. I can configure Apache to say `Server: Microsoft-IIS`. This is called Obfuscation).
2.  **Risk**: Why is `X-Powered-By: PHP 5.6` a dangerous header? (It reveals an outdated, vulnerable version).
3.  **Optimization**: If I know the site is static HTML, should I check for SQL Injection? (No. There is no database).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You have installed Wappalyzer (or know how it works).
2.  You can identify at least 3 technologies from HTTP headers.
3.  You understand that specific technologies have specific vulnerabilities (CVEs).
