# Technology Stack Fingerprinting

## 1. Unit Brief: Know Your Enemy
Fingerprinting is the art of identifying the specific technologies powering a web application. Knowing the target uses "WordPress 5.8" is infinitely more useful than knowing it uses "a CMS". Specific versions have specific vulnerabilities (CVEs).

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Scenario**: Target is running PHP 5.3 (Ancient).
*   **Attack**: You know PHP 5.3 has specific null-byte injection vulnerabilities that imply different attack vectors than PHP 8.0.
*   **Scenario**: Target uses the "Telerik UI" library.
*   **Attack**: This library has famous deserialization exploits.

## 3. Core Concepts

### HTTP Response Headers
Servers often brag about what they are.
*   `X-Powered-By: ASP.NET` -> Windows Server.
*   `Server: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)` -> Linux, Apache, Ubuntu.

### Tech-Specific Behavioral Analysis
*   **URL Structure**: `.php`, `.jsp`, `.do`, `.action` extensions reveal the backend language.
*   **Cookies**: `PHPSESSID` (PHP), `JSESSIONID` (Java), `ASP.NET_SessionId` (ASP).
*   **HTML Source**: Specific meta tags or comment structures generated by frameworks (e.g., `<!-- W3TC-include-js-head -->` hints at W3 Total Cache plugin).

### Tools
*   **Wappalyzer**: Browser extension that identifies tech on the fly.
*   **WhatWeb**: Command line scanner.

## 4. Practical Examples

### Fingerprinting via Error Messages
You send a single quote `'` to a parameter.
*   **Response**: `Fatal error: Call to undefined function... in /var/www/html/index.php`
*   **Intel**: It's PHP. The absolute path reveals the Linux file structure.

### Hash Printing
You look at the favicon hash.
*   Shodan indexes favicon hashes. If the favicon hash matches the default "Spring Boot" leaf icon, you know it's a Spring Boot app, likely susceptible to Java exploits.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Trusting Headers Blindly**: Admins can change the `Server` header to lie (Security by Obscurity). "Server: Pentagon Mainframe" is probably a joke. Validating via behavior is better.
*   **Ignoring 404 Pages**: Default 404 pages often reveal the server version (e.g., The default Tomcat 404 page is very distinct).

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **CVEs need Versions**: You cannot search for an exploit without a version number.
*   **Fingerprinting guides the attack**: Don't try IIS exploits on an Apache server.
