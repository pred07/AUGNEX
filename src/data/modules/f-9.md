# CPU, Memory, Storage, and Processes

## Introduction

Resources are finite. Your computer has limited brainpower (CPU), limited short-term memory (RAM), and limited long-term memory (Storage).

## 1. CPU (The Chef)

The Central Processing Unit executes instructions.
*   Measured in **Gigahertz (GHz)** (Speed) and **Cores** (Multi-tasking ability).
*   **Processes**: A running program is called a process. The CPU switches between them thousands of times a second.

## 2. RAM (The Countertop)

Random Access Memory is fast, volatile storage.
*   **Volatile**: If you pull the plug, data is gone.
*   **Usage**: Active programs live here.
*   **Security**: Passwords and encryption keys often sit in RAM in plain text while being used! (See: Cold Boot Attacks).

## 3. Storage (The Fridge)

Hard Drives (HDD) or Solid State Drives (SSD).
*   **Non-Volatile**: Data stays when power is off.
*   **Usage**: Files, Operating System, installed programs.

## 4. Processes

A Process is a program in execution. Every process has:
*   **PID (Process ID)**: A unique number (e.g., 1234).
*   **User**: Who owns it.
*   **Permissions**: What it can touch.

## Why This Matters

Denial of Service (DoS) attacks work by exhausting these resources. If I fill your RAM, your kernel crashes. If I use 100% CPU, your web server freezes.
