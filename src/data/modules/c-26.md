# Safe Attack Simulation Concepts

## 1. What this module covers
How to run malware in production without getting fired. The art of "Benign Hostile Activity".

## 2. Why this matters for purple teams
You must test in Production because Dev environments rarely match Production security controls. But you can't break Production.

## 3. Core concepts explained clearly

### Defanged Payloads
*   **Real Ransomware**: Encrypts disk.
*   **Simulated Ransomware**: Finds files, calculates their hashes, renames them using a reversible format, and drops a text note.
*   *Result*: Triggers the same "File Modification" alerts, but no data is lost.

### Test Accounts
*   Never use real Admin accounts for testing.
*   Create `svc_purple_test`. Monitor it closely.

### Timeboxing
*   "We will attack between 10 AM and 11 AM".
*   Alerts outside this window are REAL.

## 4. Validation examples

### EICAR Test File
*   A standard text string that all AVs recognize as "Virus".
*   `X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*`
*   **Safe**: It's just text.
*   **Test**: Drop it on disk. Does A/V delete it?
    *   If yes -> Basic AV working.
    *   If no -> Major failure.

## 5. Common gaps and failures
*   **Whitelisting the Tester**: "Oh, disable the EDR on the Red Team laptop so they can work." -> You just invalidated the test. The attack must come from a "Victim" machine with full EDR to be valid.

## 6. Key takeaways
*   **Communication**: Tell the SOC Lead *before* you start. (Unless it's a Blind Test).
*   **Rollback**: Always have a cleanup script ready.
