# Safe Attack Simulation Concepts

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers rule #1: **Do No Harm**. How to run attacks in production without firing the CEO.

### Fit in the Learning Path
You must test in Production (because that's where the data is), but you must be safe.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **De-weaponization**.
*   **Test Accounts**.
*   **Communication**.

---

## 2. Core Content

### De-weaponization
*   Real Malware: Encrypts disk.
*   Simulated Malware: Writes a file called `encrypted.txt` and pops a calculator.
*   *Goal*: Trigger the *behavior* (File Write) without the *impact* (Data Loss).

### The Test User
*   Never use real Admin credentials.
*   Create `svc_purple_test`.
*   Monitor this account specifically.

## 3. Guided Practice

### The EICAR Test
The grandfather of safe simulation.
*   String: `X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*`
*   Action: Paste into a text file.
*   Result: AV screams "VIRUS!".
*   *Safety*: It is completely harmless. It just *looks* like a virus to the engine.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Notification**: Should you warn the SOC? (Depends. "Blind Test" = No. "Purple Team Workshop" = Yes).
2.  **Scope**: Never DDoS. Never compromise PII.
3.  **Cleanup**: Always clean up your artifacts (Delete the created users/files).

---

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You vow to never run untrusted code on Prod.
2.  You use **EICAR** for AV testing.
3.  You plan your **Cleanup** before you start.
