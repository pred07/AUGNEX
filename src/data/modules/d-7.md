# Why Logging Matters in Security

## 1. Unit Brief: Digital Forensics
Logs are the digital footprints left by every action on a system. Without logs, you are blind. You cannot investigate a breach, you cannot prove compliance, and you cannot debug errors.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Scenario**: A clear breach. 50GB of data stolen.
*   **No Logs**: "We don't know how they got in. We don't know what they took. We have to notify ALL customers." (Reputation Ruined).
*   **With Logs**: "They entered via a phish on Bob's PC. They touched only the 'Public Marketing' folder. No customer data lost." (Crisis Averted).

## 3. Core Concepts

### The 3 As of Logging
*   **Audit**: Who did what? (User Activity).
*   **Alert**: Something bad happened right now! (Real-time).
*   **Analyze**: Trends over time. (Forensics).

### Legal Requirements (Compliance)
*    PCI-DSS (Credit Cards), HIPAA (Health), GDPR (Privacy) **MANDATE** logging. If you don't log, you are breaking the law.

## 4. Practical Examples

### The Blank Screen
You get hacked. You verify the server.
`cat /var/log/auth.log` -> File is empty.
The attacker deleted the logs because you stored them locally.
*   **Lesson**: Logs must be shipped off the server immediately (Centralized Logging).

### Detecting Brute Force
You look at logs.
*   10:00:01 - Failed Login (Admin)
*   10:00:02 - Failed Login (Admin)
*   10:00:03 - Failed Login (Admin)
*   *Observation*: This pattern IS the attack.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Logging everything**: "Debug" level logging in production usually crashes the server disk space. Info/Warning/Error is standard.
*   **Not timestamps**: If your router generates logs in UTC and your server in EST, correlating them is a nightmare. Use NTP (Network Time Protocol).

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **If it's not logged, it didn't happen**: You cannot prove innocence without logs.
*   **Logs are Evidence**: Protect them like evidence.
