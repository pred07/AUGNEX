# Why Logging Matters in Security

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module is the "Black Box" of flight recording. We explain why logs are the only truth in a digital world.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Without logs, a breach is a mystery. With logs, it is a solvable crime.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Forensics**: Reconstructing the past.
*   **Compliance**: The law requires it.
*   **Troubleshooting**: Security isn't the only consumer.

## 2. Core Content

### The Universal Truth
Logs record discrete events at specific times.
*   `Mar 10 10:00:01 server sshd[123]: Accepted password for root from 1.2.3.4`

### The Use Cases
1.  **Detection**: Real-time alerting ("Root login detected").
2.  **Investigation**: "What did Root do *after* logging in?"
3.  **Evidence**: Legal proof for prosecution.

### The Challenge
*   **Volume**: Too many logs (Noise).
*   **Retention**: Disk space is expensive. (How long do we keep them?).
*   **Integrity**: Hackers delete logs to hide tracks.

## 3. Guided Practice

### The Missing Log
**Scenario**:
A server was hacked. You log in to investigate.
You run `last` (shows login history). It is empty.
You check `/var/log/auth.log`. It is deleted.

**Conclusion**:
The attacker wiped the logs.
**Lesson**: Logs must be shipped *off* the server instantly (Remote Logging) so current hackers can't delete past history.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Encryption**: Should logs be encrypted? (Yes. They contain sensitive info like usernames and URLs).
2.  **Time**: Why is NTP (Network Time Protocol) critical? (If Server A is 5 minutes behind Server B, you cannot correlate the attack timeline).
3.  **Cost**: Which logs are "high value"? (Auth logs, Firewall drops). Which are "low value"? (Debug logs, success loops).

---

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You treat Logs as **Evidence**.
2.  You understand the risk of Local Logging vs Remote Logging.
3.  You know that "Time" is the axis of all investigation.
