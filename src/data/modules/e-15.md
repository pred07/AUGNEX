# Web Authentication Mechanisms

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module attacks the Front Door. We look at Basic Auth, Forms, OAuth, and how they fail.

### Fit in the Learning Path
If you can bypass authentication, you win. It is the highest impact vulnerability (often Critical).

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Brute Force** vs **Credential Stuffing**.
*   **OAuth** (Login with Google) flows.
*   **2FA Bypass** concepts.

## 2. Core Content

### Basic Auth
*   Header: `Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=`
*   **Weakness**: That string is just Base64 encoded `admin:admin`. It is NOT encrypted. Easily sniffable over HTTP.

### Form-Based Auth
*   POST request with `username` and `password`.
*   **Weakness**: Vulnerable to SQL Injection (`' OR 1=1--`) and Brute Force.

### OAuth 2.0
*   "Delegated Authorization". You give the app a "Token", not your Google password.
*   **Weakness**: Misconfigured redirect URIs allow attackers to steal the Token.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Attack Logic
**Scenario**: You want to enter a site.

**Method 1: Credential Stuffing**
*   Assumption: Users reuse passwords.
*   Action: Take a leaked database from LinkedIn/Adobe. Try those pairs on the target.
*   *Success Rate*: Very High.

**Method 2: Brute Force**
*   Action: Try `admin/123456`, `admin/password`.
*   *Limitation*: Account Lockout policies (After 5 attempts, account locks).

**Method 3: Bypass**
*   Action: Visit `/admin` while modifying the Cookie to `authorized=true`.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **MFA**: Does Multi-Factor Authentication kill Brute Force? (Yes. Most effective defense).
2.  **Rate Limiting**: Why should a login page slow down after 3 failed attempts? (To make Brute Force mathematically impossible in a human timeframe).
3.  **Forgot Password**: Why is the "Forgot Password" flow often weaker than the Login flow? (Enumeration: "Email sent" vs "User not found". Security Questions are often guessable).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can decode a Basic Auth header.
2.  You explain why Credential Stuffing is more dangerous than random Brute Forcing.
3.  You understand that Authentication (Who are you?) is different from Authorization (What can you do?).
