# CVE, CVSS, and Risk Context

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module explains how the industry tracks vulnerabilities. We decode **CVE** (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and **CVSS** (Common Vulnerability Scoring System).

### Fit in the Learning Path
When you find a bug, you need to name it and score it. "I found a bad thing" is not a report. "I found CVE-2023-XYZ, CVSS 9.8" is a report.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   The **CVE ID** format.
*   How **CVSS** is calculated (Exploitability + Impact).
*   Why a "High" score might be "Low" risk in reality.

## 2. Core Content

### CVE (The Dictionary)
*   Format: `CVE-YYYY-NNNN`.
*   Example: `CVE-2017-0144` (EternalBlue).
*   Managed by MITRE. It ensures everyone is talking about the same bug.

### CVSS (The Score)
A number from 0.0 to 10.0.
*   **Base Score**: Intrinsic properties. (Is it remote? Does it need auth?).
*   **Temporal Score**: Does exploit code exist? Is there a patch?
*   **Environmental Score**: Is this server critical?

### The Vector String
`CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H` (Score 9.8).
*   **AV:N** (Network) - Remote.
*   **AC:L** (Low Complexity) - Easy.
*   **PR:N** (None) - No password needed.
*   **UI:N** (None) - No user click needed.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Scoring a Bug
Use the [CVSS Calculator](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator).

**Scenario**:
You find a bug.
1.  **Attack Vector**: Network (AV:N).
2.  **Complexity**: High (AC:H) - Need a race condition.
3.  **Privileges**: None (PR:N).
4.  **Impact**: Full System Control (C:H, I:H, A:H).

**Result**: Only 8.1 (High), not 10.0 (Critical), because it's distinctively complex to pull off.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Context**: If a CVSS 10.0 bug exists on a server that is unplugged from the network, what is the *Real* risk? (Zero).
2.  **Prioritization**: Why do effective teams patch "Exploitable" Mediums before "Theoretical" Highs?
3.  **Inflation**: Why do security researchers sometimes exaggerate the score? (Marketing/Bounty payouts).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can decode a CVE ID.
2.  You understand that CVSS is about *Technical Severity*, not necessarily *Risk*.
3.  You know where to look up CVEs (NVD, MITRE).
