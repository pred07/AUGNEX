# CVE, CVSS, and Risk Context

## 1. Unit Brief: Speaking the Language of Vulnerability
Finding a bug is one thing; communicating its severity is another. CVEs give vulnerabilities names, and CVSS gives them a score. However, Context determines the actual Risk.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Scenario**: You find a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. CVSS 9.8 (Critical).
*   **Context A**: It's on a server deep inside the network, air-gapped from the internet. **Risk: Medium**.
*   **Context B**: It's on the main web server exposed to the world. **Risk: Critical**.
Understanding this difference saves you from panic attacks.

## 3. Core Concepts

### CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
A unique ID for a known vulnerability.
*   Format: `CVE-YEAR-ID` (e.g., `CVE-2021-44228` for Log4j).
*   Use: To look up exploits and patches.

### CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)
A standard for scoring difficulty and impact.
*   **Base Score (0.1 - 10.0)**:
    *   **Low**: Hard to exploit, low impact.
    *   **Critical**: Easy to exploit (Remote, No Auth), High impact (RCE).
*   **Vector**: `AV:N/AC:L...` (Attack Vector: Network / Attack Complexity: Low).

### Risk = Likelihood * Impact
*   **Likelihood**: How easy is it to pull off? (CVSS covers this).
*   **Impact**: What happens if it succeeds? (Business context).

## 4. Practical Examples

### Searching for CVEs
You find a banner: `Apache Struts 2.3.5`.
1.  Google: "Apache Struts 2.3.5 CVE"
2.  Result: CVE-2017-5638.
3.  Check Score: 10.0 (Critical).
4.  Check Exploit: "Metasploit module available".
5.  **Conclusion**: Drop everything and patch/exploit this.

### Contextualizing a Risk
*   **Finding**: SQL Injection on `internal-tool.company.local`.
*   **CVSS**: 8.5 (High).
*   **Real Risk**: To exploit this, I first need to be on the VPN. So it's not "Critical" to the outside world, but it is "Critical" for insider threats.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **CVE-Chasing**: Thinking every CVE needs to be exploited. Many triggers only under weird configurations that the target doesn't use.
*   **Ignoring Lows**: Chaining 3 "Low" bugs often creates 1 "High" bug.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Score != Risk**: CVSS is a technical score. Risk is a business decision.
*   **Search Efficiently**: Use databases like `cvedetails.com` or `exploit-db.com`.
