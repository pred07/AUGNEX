# Social Media Intelligence (SOCMINT)

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
People are the weakest link. SOCMINT focuses on gathering intelligence from Social Media (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Reddit, Instagram). For a Sentinel, this means mapping organizational charts, identifying VIP targets for phishing simulation, and tracking threat actor chatter.

### Learning Objectives
*   Map an **Organization Structure** using LinkedIn.
*   Geolocation using Social Media images.
*   Sentiment analysis and chatter monitoring.

## 2. Core Content

### Corporate Recon (LinkedIn)
LinkedIn is a goldmine for attackers and red teams.
*   **Tech Stack Mapping:** Job posts reveal the stack. "Hiring Firewall Engineer (Palo Alto)" -> They use Palo Alto.
*   **Org Chart:** Who reports to the CISO? Who is the "Junior Admin"? (Junior admins are great targets—high access, low suspicion).
*   **OPSEC:** *Never* view profiles logged in. Use search engines (`site:linkedin.com/in "Target Company" "security"`).

### Thread Actor Chatter (Twitter/X & Reddit)
*   Infosec Twitter is faster than any threat feed.
*   **Monitoring:** Track keywords (Company Name, "Hacked", "Leak").
*   **Actor Behavior:** Actors often brag on Twitter or Reddit (r/blackhat, etc.) before a breach is public.

### Geolocation (Identity)
*   **Scenario:** Threat actor posts a photo of their desk.
*   **Clues:** Power plug type? Weather? Background landmarks? Reflection in the monitor?
*   **Tools:** Reverse Image Search (Yandex is best for faces/locations, Google Lens for objects).

## 3. Lab: The Employee Leak
**Scenario:** Determine the email format of "Acme Corp".
1.  **Find:** Employee names on LinkedIn (Jane Doe, John Smith).
2.  **Google:** `site:acme.com "Jane Doe"` or `"@acme.com"`.
3.  **Pattern:** You find `jane.doe@acme.com` in a PDF metadata.
4.  **Inference:** Email format is `firstname.lastname@acme.com`.
5.  **Expansion:** You can now guess the email of the CEO.

## 4. Ethics & Privacy
*   Collecting data on public figures (CEO) is standard.
*   Collecting data on low-level employees' families is **Forbidden / Toxic**. Do not cross the line into stalking.
*   **GDPR:** Storing PII of EU citizens has legal implications.
