# Social Media Intelligence (SOCMINT)

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
Humans are the weakest link. They post their badges, their workstations, their travel plans, and their organizational hierarchy on Social Media. SOCMINT is the art of harvesting this data to build a target profile.

### Learning Objectives
*   Pivot from a username to a real identity (Sherlock/Maigret).
*   Extract geolocation from images.
*   Map an organizational chart using LinkedIn.

## 2. Core Content

### Username Enumeration
People reuse usernames. `CoolHacker99` on Reddit is likely `CoolHacker99` on GitHub and Steam.
*   **Tool:** `Sherlock` (Python cli).
*   **Usage:** `python3 sherlock.py username` -> Checks 300+ sites.

### LinkedIn Intelligence
*   **The Gold Mine:** Job Descriptions. "Looking for Firewall Engineer with Palo Alto experience." -> **Intel:** Target uses Palo Alto firewalls.
*   **Hierarchy:** "Reports to CISO." -> **Intel:** Maps the decision chain.

### Metadata & EXIF
*   Images often contain GPS coordinates.
*   **Tool:** `exiftool image.jpg`
*   **Scrubbing:** Most social platforms (FB/Twitter) strip EXIF on upload. You need *original* files (hosted on blogs, personal sites).

## 3. Lab: Cross-Platform Pivot

### Scenario
You have a target username: `jdoe_dev_1990` found in a breach.
1.  Run Sherlock: Found on GitHub.
2.  Github has a repo `dotfiles` with an email: `john.doe@gmail.com`.
3.  Forgot Password on Gmail: "Recovery phone ends in 55".
4.  Google Maps Review by `John Doe`: Lives in Austin, TX.
5.  **Result:** You went from a username to a Location and Email.

## 4. Reflection
1.  What is the ethical line between SOCMINT and Stalking?
2.  How does GDPR impact SOCMINT? (PII collection is regulated in EU).
