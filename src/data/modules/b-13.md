# Python for Security: Basics & Requests

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
Python is the industry standard for security tool development due to its readability and massive library ecosystem. While Bash is for gluing tools, Python is for *building* tools. This module focuses on setting up a dev environment and interacting with the Web.

### Learning Objectives
*   Set up a Python Virtual Environment (`venv`).
*   Understand Python syntax for security (Strings, Lists, Dicts).
*   Use the `requests` library to interact with HTTP services.

## 2. Core Content

### The Environment
Always isolate dependencies.
```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install requests
```

### Data Structures for Hackers
*   **Lists:** Organizing targets. `ips = ["10.0.0.1", "10.0.0.2"]`
*   **Dictionaries:** Storing credentials/configs. `creds = {"user": "admin", "pass": "12345"}`

### The `requests` Library
The Swiss Army knife for Web Hacking (Fuzzing, Brute-forcing, API testing).

```python
import requests

url = "http://target.com/login"
data = {"username": "admin", "password": "password123"}

response = requests.post(url, data=data)

if "Welcome" in response.text:
    print(f"[+] Success: {data['password']}")
else:
    print(f"[-] Failed: {response.status_code}")
```

## 3. Lab: Directory Fuzzer

### Task
Write a script that takes a URL and a wordlist, checking for existing pages.

```python
import requests
import sys

target = sys.argv[1]
wordlist = open("common.txt", "r")

for line in wordlist:
    directory = line.strip()
    full_url = f"{target}/{directory}"
    r = requests.get(full_url)
    if r.status_code != 404:
        print(f"[+] Found: {full_url} ({r.status_code})")
```

---

## 4. Reflection
1.  Why use `sys.argv`? (To accept command line arguments).
2.  What is the difference between `requests.get()` and `requests.post()`? (GET retrieves method, POST submits data).
