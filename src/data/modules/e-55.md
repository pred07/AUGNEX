# Writing Effective Technical Findings

## 1. Unit Brief: The Real Product
You are not paid to hack; you are paid to write a report about hacking. If your finding is "I hacked it," you failed. You must explain *Title*, *Impact*, *Likelihood*, and *Remediation*.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Bad Finding**: "XSS on Search."
*   **Good Finding**: "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) on Search Parameter allowing Session Hijacking of Administrators."

## 3. Core Concepts

### The 5 Ws
*   **What**: XSS.
*   **Where**: `/search?q=...`
*   **Who**: Affects any user clicking the link.
*   **Why**: Input is not sanitized before output.
*   **How**: Steps to reproduce.

### Remediation
Don't just say "Fix it."
*   **Bad**: "Sanitize input."
*   **Good**: "Implement Context-Aware Output Encoding using a library like OWASP Java Encoder. Avoid using `.innerHTML` in JavaScript."

## 4. Practical Examples

### Structuring a Proof of Concept (PoC)
1.  **URL**: `http://site.com/search?q=<script>alert(1)</script>`
2.  **Request**: (Paste raw HTTP request).
3.  **Screenshot**: Show the alert box.
4.  **Steps**:
    1.  Navigate to URL.
    2.  Observe popup.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Copy-Pasting Scanner Output**: "Nessus says this is bad." Clients pay for *your* analysis, not Nessus output. Verify it.
*   **Vague Titles**: "Web Vulnerability." (Which one??).

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Reproducibility**: If the developer can't reproduce it, they won't fix it.
*   **Clarity**: Write for a developer, not a hacker.
