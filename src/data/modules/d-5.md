# Visibility as a Security Requirement

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers the "dark matter" of the network. **Shadow IT**, **IoT**, and **BYOD** (Bring Your Own Device).

### Fit in the Learning Path
"You cannot protect what you cannot see." If Marketing buys a server and puts it under a desk, and you don't know it exists, you cannot patch it.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Asset Inventory**.
*   **Shadow IT**.
*   **East-West** traffic visibility.

## 2. Core Content

### The Asset Inventory
A list of every IP, MAC, and Software License owned by the company.
*   *Reality Check*: Most companies are 80% accurate. The 20% gap is where they get hacked.

### Shadow IT
Employees bypassing IT to get work done.
*   Using Dropbox instead of the slow Corporate Share.
*   Spinning up an AWS server with a personal credit card.
*   **Risk**: No logs, no patches, no monitoring.

### East-West Traffic
Traffic *between* servers inside the LAN.
*   Legacy monitoring only looked at **North-South** (Internet to LAN).
*   Attackers move laterally (East-West). You need internal sensors.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Finding the Blind Spot
**Scenario**:
You monitor the Firewall (Exit) and the Domain Controller (Auth).
An attacker plugs a laptop into a meeting room jack and scans the local printer.

**Question**: Do you see this?
*   **Firewall**: No. Traffic didn't leave the building.
*   **DC**: No. No login occurred.
*   **Result**: Blind Spot.
*   **Fix**: NAC (Network Access Control) or Internal IDSs.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **IoT**: Why is the Smart Fridge a security risk? (It runs a stripped-down Linux, never gets patched, and sits on the same network as the CEO's laptop).
2.  **Scanning**: How often should you scan for new assets? (Continuously. Weekly is too slow).
3.  **Policy**: Should you ban Shadow IT? (You can try, but it's better to offer a secure alternative. If you just block Dropbox, they will use Google Drive).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You accept that "100% Visibility" is the goal but rarely the reality.
2.  You treat Shadow IT as a symptom of bad IT service.
3.  You understand the difference between North-South and East-West monitoring.
