# Visibility as a Security Requirement

## 1. Unit Brief: Light in the Dark
Visibility is knowing what assets you have and what they are doing. You cannot protect a server if you don't know it exists ("Shadow IT").

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **The Breach**: The hackers entered via an old testing server that the dev team spun up in AWS 2 years ago and forgot about. It had no patches and no monitoring.
*   **The Cause**: Lack of Asset Visibility.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Asset Inventory
Hardware and Software.
*   **Hardware**: Laptops, Servers, Routers, IoT Thermostats.
*   **Software**: "Do we have Java installed? Which version? On how many machines?" (Log4j nightmare).

### Network Mapping
Knowing your topology.
*   "What ports are open to the internet?"
*   "Does the WiFi network have access to the Database?"

### Blind Spots
*   **Encrypted Traffic**: HTTPS is great for privacy, bad for monitoring. Malware hides in HTTPS. (Solution: TLS Inspect/Proxy).
*   **Remote Workers**: If they aren't on VPN, you can't see their traffic. (Solution: Endpoint Agents).

## 4. Practical Examples

### Nmap for Defense
Defenders run Nmap too.
```bash
nmap -p- 192.168.1.0/24
```
*   **Goal**: Find rogue services. "Why is there an FTP server on the CEO's laptop?"

### Software Inventory Query (Osquery)
Using a tool like `osquery` to ask your fleet:
`SELECT * FROM programs WHERE name LIKE '%Java%';`
*   Result: A list of every vulnerable Java instance in minutes.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Trusting the Spreadsheet**: The manual Excel sheet of assets is always wrong. Use automated discovery tools.
*   **Ignoring IoT**: The "Smart Aquarium" thermometer that hacked the Casino.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Discovery is Continuous**: New devices appear daily. Scan daily.
*   **Deep Visibility**: It's not just "It's a Windows Box". It's "It's a Windows Box running Chrome v88 with extension X installed".
