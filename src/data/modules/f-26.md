# Cybersecurity Fundamentals & Terminology

## Introduction

You cannot join the industry if you don't speak the language. Here are the core terms you will hear every day.

## The Teams

*   **Red Team**: The attackers. They emulate the enemy to test defenses.
*   **Blue Team**: The defenders. They monitor, detect, and respond.
*   **Purple Team**: Collaborative. Red and Blue sitting together to improve faster.

## The Concepts

*   **Vulnerability**: A flaw in the system (e.g., A missing lock on a door).
*   **Exploit**: code that takes advantage of the flaw (e.g., A key that opens the lock).
*   **Payload**: The code that runs *after* the exploit works (e.g., Stealing the jewels).
*   **Zero-Day**: A vulnerability that is unknown to the vendor. No patch exists yet.

## Threat Actors

*   **Script Kiddies**: Unskilled, use others' tools.
*   **Hacktivists**: Political motivation (e.g., Anonymous).
*   **Nation States (APT)**: Advanced Persistent Threats. Funded by governments. Highly skilled, patient.
*   **Insider Threat**: A disgruntled employee. The most dangerous threat.

## The Kill Chain (Lockheed Martin)

1.  **Recon**: Researching.
2.  **Weaponization**: Building the exploit.
3.  **Delivery**: Sending the email/link.
4.  **Exploitation**: Triggering the bug.
5.  **Installation**: Installing malware/backdoor.
6.  **C2 (Command & Control)**: Remote control.
7.  **Actions on Objectives**: Stealing data.

## Why This Matters

When writing a report, you never say "I hacked it." You say "I identified a vulnerability and successfully exploited it to achieve remote code execution." Professionalism matters.
