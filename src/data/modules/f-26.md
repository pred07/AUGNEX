# Cybersecurity Fundamentals & Terminology

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module defines the language of the trade. We clarify confusing terms: **Threat vs Vulnerability vs Risk**, and **Red vs Blue vs Purple**.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Precision of language is critical. If you tell a CEO "We have a Threat" when you mean "Vulnerability", you lose credibility.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   The Risk Formula.
*   The Color Wheel of InfoSec.
*   APT (Advanced Persistent Threat).

## 2. Core Content

### The Golden Formula
**Risk = Threat x Vulnerability x Impact**

*   **Asset**: What you are protecting (Data, Server).
*   **Vulnerability**: A weakness (Unpatched Windows 7).
*   **Threat**: The potential actor (Ransomware Gang).
*   **Risk**: The probability of loss.
    *   *Example*: A vulnerability with NO threat (a server unplugged in a vault) has Zero Risk.

### The Teams
*   **Red Team**: Attackers. Goal: Emulate a real adversary to test defenses.
*   **Blue Team**: Defenders. Goal: Detect and block attacks.
*   **Purple Team**: Collaboration. Red and Blue work together to improve detection.
*   **White Team**: Referees/Management.

### Key Terms
*   **Exploit**: Code that leverages a vulnerability.
*   **Payload**: The code that runs *after* the exploit works (e.g., a Reverse Shell).
*   **Zero-Day**: A vulnerability known to attackers but not the vendor (no patch exists).

## 3. Guided Practice

### Scenario Analysis
Classify the following statements.

**Statement 1**: "We found a SQL Injection flaw in the login page."
*   **Type**: Vulnerability.

**Statement 2**: "The Lazarus Group is targeting banks."
*   **Type**: Threat.

**Statement 3**: "If they hack the DB, we lose $10M in fines."
*   **Type**: Impact.

**Statement 4**: "We need to patch this tonight because an exploit code was released on Twitter."
*   **Type**: Increased Risk (Threat capability went up).

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Prioritization**: You have 100 vulnerabilities. You can only fix 5. How do you choose? (Highest Risk = High Impact + High Threat).
2.  **Perspective**: Why do Red Teams often fail to help Blue Teams? (Ego. Hiding methods instead of teaching them).
3.  **Zero-Day**: Are Zero-Days common? (No. Most hacks happen via 3-year-old unpatched bugs).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can write down the Risk Formula.
2.  You can explain the difference between a Vulnerability (Weakness) and an Exploit (Tool).
3.  You identify as a future Red, Blue, or Purple teamer.
