# Why Security Controls Fail

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module is a post-mortem on failure. Why did the Firewall miss it? Why was EDR silent?

### Fit in the Learning Path
Buying the tool isn't enough. Configuration drift, shadow IT, and bypasses are the reality.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Misconfiguration**.
*   **Visibility Gaps**.
*   **Evasion**.

## 2. Core Content

### Top Failure Modes
1.  **Default Configs**: "Install Next-Gen Firewall -> Click Next -> Finish". (It's now a glorified router).
2.  **Missing Agents**: "We have EDR on 90% of machines." (The attacker landed on the 10% without it).
3.  **Human Error**: An admin temporarily disabled the AV to install a printer and forgot to turn it back on.
4.  **Logging Failures**: The disk filled up, so logs stopped being sent.

## 3. Guided Practice

### The "Silent" Failure
**Scenario**: You run a malware simulation.
*   **Expected**: EDR Alert.
*   **Actual**: Silence.

**Debug**:
1.  Was the EDR agent running? (Yes).
2.  Was it connected to the cloud? (No. Firewall blocked the specific EDR reporting port).
3.  **Result**: The endpoint blocked the malware, but the SOC never knew because the alert couldn't leave the building.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Assumption**: "It's green in the dashboard so it works." (Dangerous. Test it).
2.  **Change Management**: Who changed the firewall rule? (Unauthorized changes break security controls constantly).
3.  **Decay**: Controls rot. A rule usually works today might be bypassed tomorrow by a new tool.

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You trust **Tests**, not **Dashboards**.
2.  You look for the "Missing 10%" of coverage.
3.  You understand that **Configuration** is harder than **Installation**.
