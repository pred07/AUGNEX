# Linux Privilege Escalation Fundamentals

## 1. Unit Brief: The Penguin's Weakness
Linux is secure by design, but insecure by configuration. Weak file permissions, dangerous Sudo rights, and unpatched Kernels are the way up.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
Most web servers run Linux. If you hack a web app, you land in a Linux shell.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Sudo Rights
`sudo` allows running commands as other users.
*   **Dangerous Binaries**: `vim`, `less`, `find`, `nmap`, `python`. All allow shell escape.
*   **GTFOBins**: The encyclopedia of how to use these binaries to break out.

### SUID Binaries
Executables with the `s` bit set. They run with the permissions of the *owner* (usually root), not the *user*.
*   `rwsr-xr-x root root /bin/ping` (Normal).
*   `rwsr-xr-x root root /usr/bin/python` (Detailed Exploit: Run root python script).

### Cron Jobs
Scheduled tasks.
*   **Attack**: If a cron job runs a script `/opt/backup.sh` as root, and *you* can write to `/opt/backup.sh`, you can replace it with your code. Cron will execute it for you.

## 4. Practical Examples

### SUID Exploit
1.  Find SUIDs: `find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null`
2.  Result: `/usr/bin/find` is SUID.
3.  Exploit: `/usr/bin/find . -exec /bin/sh -p \;`
4.  Result: A root shell (`#`).

### Kernel Exploit (DirtyPipe)
1.  Check Kernel: `uname -r` -> `5.8.0`.
2.  Search: "Linux 5.8 exploit".
3.  Found: "DirtyPipe (CVE-2022-0847)".
4.  Compile and run code.
5.  Result: You overwrite `/etc/passwd`.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Ignoring File Permissions**: You see a specialized software installed. Check if its config file is world-readable. It might contain the DB password for root.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **GTFOBins**: Bookmark this site.
*   **Permissions**: `ls -l` is the most important command.
