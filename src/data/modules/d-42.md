# Least Privilege and Access Control

## 1. Unit Brief: The Need to Know
Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP): Give a user the *exact* permissions needed to do their job, and nothing more.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Snowden**: A contractor with "God Mode" access to NSA systems.
*   **Malware**: If malware runs as `User`, it can delete user files. If it runs as `Admin`, it can erase the OS.

## 3. Core Concepts

### RBAC (Role Based Access Control)
*   **Role**: "HR Manager".
*   **Permission**: "Read User Records".
*   Assign User to Role. Don't assign Permissions to Users directly.

### PAM (Privileged Access Management)
*   **Vault**: Store Admin passwords in a safe (CyberArk/Thycotic).
*   **Check-out**: Admin requests password for 2 hours.
*   **Rotation**: Password changes automatically after use.

### Separation of Duties
*   The person who *requests* the payment cannot be the person who *approves* the payment.
*   Prevents fraud.

## 4. Practical Examples

### Sudo Rights
*   **Bad**: `bob ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL` (Bob is Root).
*   **Good**: `bob ALL=(root) /usr/bin/apt-get update` (Bob can only update software).

### AWS IAM
*   **Bad**: `Action: "*", Resource: "*"` (Admin).
*   **Good**: `Action: "s3:GetObject", Resource: "bucket-A/*"`.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Permission Creep**: Bob moves from HR to IT. He keeps his HR permissions. Now he has both. Review access quarterly!
*   **Convenience**: "Just make him Admin, we'll fix it later." (Narrator: They never fixed it).

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Default Deny**: Start with Zero access. Add what is needed.
*   **Limit impact**: Least Privilege limits lateral movement.
