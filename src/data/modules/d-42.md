# Presenting to Executives

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers **Soft Skills**. How to talk to the C-Suite (CEO, CISO, CFO).

### Fit in the Learning Path
You need budget. You need buy-in. You need to convince non-technical leaders to care about security.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Business Alignment**.
*   **Metric Selection**.
*   **Storytelling**.

## 2. Core Content

### The Language of Business
Executives speak: **Money**, **Risk**, **Reputation**, **Speed**.
*   They do *not* speak: TCP/IP, SQL Injection, Buffer Overflow.
*   *Translation*: "Buffer Overflow" -> "Risk of System Crash and Data Loss".

### Metrics that Matter
*   *Bad*: "We blocked 1 million packets." (So what?).
*   *Good*: "We reduced Mean Time to Respond by 50%, saving the company potential downtime costs."

## 3. Guided Practice

### The Pitch
**Goal**: Ask for $50k for a new Firewall.
**Bad Pitch**: "The new Palo Alto has App-ID and does SSL decryption really fast."
**Good Pitch**: "Our current visibility is blind to encrypted traffic. Ideally, we need to inspect this traffic to prevent IP theft. An investment of $50k closes this gap and aligns with our PCI compliance goals."

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **FUD**: Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt. (Don't use it. It works once, then you lose credibility. Use Evidence).
2.  **Brevity**: Executives have 5 minutes. Get to the point.
3.  **Solutions**: Never bring a problem without a proposed solution (and its cost).

---

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You link every technical problem to a **Business Risk**.
2.  You stop using FUD.
3.  You understand that Security is a **Business Enabler**, not the "Department of No".
