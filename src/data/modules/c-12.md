# Validating Authentication Visibility

## 1. What this module covers
Ensuring you can see *who* is doing *what*. Authentication is the primary way lateral movement happens.

## 2. Why this matters for purple teams
If you can't distinguish between "Bob doing work" and "Hacker as Bob dumping the database", you lose.

## 3. Core concepts explained clearly

### Logon Types (Windows)
*   **Type 2 (Interactive)**: Keyboard/Screen. (Physically present or VNC).
*   **Type 3 (Network)**: Accessing a file share or PSExec. (Lateral Movement).
*   **Type 10 (RDP)**: Remote Desktop.

### Failure Reasons
*   **Bad Password**: User forgot it.
*   **User Unknown**: Brute force against random names.
*   **Account Locked**: Brute force success (denial of service).

## 4. Validation examples

### Lateral Movement Validation
1.  **Action**: Use `psexec` to jump from PC-A to PC-B.
2.  **Expected Log**:
    *   On PC-B: Event 4624 (Logon Success).
    *   Logon Type: 3.
    *   Source IP: PC-A IP.
    *   Process Name: `PSEXESVC.exe`.
3.  **Verification**: Search SIEM for `PSEXESVC`. If empty -> Blind Spot.

## 5. Common gaps and failures
*   **Kerberos Blindness**: Ignoring DC logs (Event 4768/4769). These show Ticket requests (Golden Ticket/Kerberoasting).
*   **Noise Filtering**: "Filter out Event 4624 because it is too noisy." Now you are blind to successful lateral movement.

## 6. Key takeaways
*   **Success Logs matter**: Brute force makes "Fail" logs. Actual hacking makes "Success" logs.
*   **Correlation**: Auth Log + Source IP is the key.
