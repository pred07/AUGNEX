# Cloud Architecture & Shared Responsibility

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
The Cloud is not a magic box; it is someone else's computer (usually Amazon's, Microsoft's, or Google's). This module defines the foundational model of Cloud Security: **The Shared Responsibility Model**. Getting this wrong is the cause of 99% of cloud breaches.

### Learning Objectives
*   Differentiate between **IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS** service models.
*   Clearly define where the CSP's (Cloud Service Provider) job ends and yours begins.
*   Understand the **Well-Architected Framework** security pillar.

## 2. Core Content

### IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS
The level of control (and responsibility) changes based on the service type.

| Model | Example | You Manage | CSP Manages |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IaaS** | AWS EC2 (VM) | OS, Apps, Data, **Patches**, Firewall | Hardware, Network Cables, Power |
| **PaaS** | AWS RDS (DB) | App Code, Data Schema | OS Patching, Hardware, Backups |
| **SaaS** | Gmail / Salesforce | Access Policy, Data Content | EVERYTHING (Code, DB, OS, HW) |

### The Shared Responsibility Model
Amazon's Rule: "AWS is responsible for security **OF** the cloud. You are responsible for security **IN** the cloud."
*   **Example:** If an AWS Data Center burns down, it's AWS's fault.
*   **Example:** If you leave an S3 bucket with customer data open to the public (`0.0.0.0/0`), it is **YOUR** fault.

### Cloud Native Design
Don't "Lift and Shift" (copying on-prem servers to EC2). Use Cloud Native patterns (Lambda, DynamoDB) to offload patching responsibility to the vendor.

## 3. Lab: The Liability Line

### Scenario
Your company uses AWS RDS (Relational Database Service).

1.  **Event 1:** The underlying MySQL version has a critical vulnerability. 
    *   *Who patches it?* **AWS** (It's PaaS).
2.  **Event 2:** A developer sets the database password to "password123".
    *   *Who is liable for the breach?* **YOU** (Identity & Access is always the customer).
3.  **Event 3:** The physical disk drive fails in the AWS Data Center.
    *   *Who replaces it?* **AWS**.

## 4. Reflection
1.  Why is SaaS commonly called "Shadow IT"? (Because employees can sign up for Dropbox/Slack without IT knowing, creating unmanaged data silos).
2.  Does using AWS/Azure make you compliant with HIPAA/PCI automatically? (No. It gives you a compliant *foundation*, but you can still build a non-compliant app on top of it).
