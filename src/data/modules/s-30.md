# CTI Program Management

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
Building a CTI capability from scratch. It's not just buying a feed. It's about People, Processes, and Technology. This module covers Stakeholder Analysis and defining Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs).

### Learning Objectives
*   Conduct a **Stakeholder Analysis** (Who needs intel?).
*   Define **PIRs** (Priority Intelligence Requirements).
*   Measure success (Metrics).

## 2. Core Content

### Stakeholders
You serve the business.
1.  **SOC:** Needs IOCs and Signatures (Tactical).
2.  **Incident Response:** Needs Attribution and TTPs (Operational).
3.  **Vuln Management:** Needs "Exploited in the Wild" flags (Operational).
4.  **C-Suite:** Needs Industry Trends and Geopolitical Risk (Strategic).

### Developing PIRs
A PIR asks a question that drives collection.
*   **Bad PIR:** "What are the threats?"
*   **Good PIR:** "What ransomware groups are targeting the Healthcare sector in North America?"

### Metrics (KPIs)
How do you prove value?
*   **Bad Metric:** "Number of IOCs ingested" (More noise is not better).
*   **Good Metric:** "Defensive actions taken based on Intel" or "Mean Time To Detection (MTTD) reduction due to CTI alerts."

## 3. Lab: Building the Charter

### Task
You are hired to start the CTI team at a Bank.

1.  **Interview Stakeholders:** Ask the CISO "What keeps you up at night?" (Answer: wire fraud).
2.  **Draft PIR 1:** "What TTPs are used by actors targeting SWIFT payment systems?"
3.  **Plan Collection:** Join FS-ISAC (Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center).
4.  **Defined Output:** Weekly "Financial Threat Landscape" report to CISO.

## 4. Reflection
1.  Why is an ISAC (Information Sharing and Analysis Center) valuable? (Herd immunity. If Bank A gets hit, they share the IOCs so Bank B can block it before they get hit).
2.  What happens if you don't define PIRs? (You collect garbage data, drown in noise, and fail to answer the business's questions).
