# Emerging Threats & Forecasting

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
Looking 5 years into the future. What threats are on the horizon?

### Learning Objectives
*   Analyze **Deepfakes** and AI threats.
*   Understand **Quantum Decryption** risks.
*   Forecast **Supply Chain** evolution.

## 2. Core Content

### 1. Deepfakes (Vishing 2.0)
*   *Threat:* AI voice cloning calls the Finance Dept: "Hi, this is the CEO. Wire $5M."
*   *Defense:* Process validation (Call back on internal line). Audio detection is failing.

### 2. Quantum Computing (Y2Q)
*   *Threat:* Quantum computers break RSA/ECC encryption.
*   *Harvest Now, Decrypt Later:* Actors are stealing encrypted data *now* to read it in 10 years.
*   *Defense:* Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC).

### 3. Edge/IoT Attacks
*   *Threat:* 5G devices bypassing the corporate firewall.
*   *Defense:* Zero Trust (Assume the network is hostile).

## 3. Lab: Horizon Scanning
**Trend:** Remote Work is permanent.
**Forecast:** "Home Router" compromise will become a primary vector for Enterprise entry.
**Action:** Extend EDR to home devices? VPN mandates?
