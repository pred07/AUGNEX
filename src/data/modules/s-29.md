# Risk Analysis & Intelligence Integration

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
Intelligence is an input to Risk. CTI tells you the **Threat Probability**, which modifies the Risk equation. This module covers mapping CTI to the **FAIR** model (Factor Analysis of Information Risk).

### Learning Objectives
*   Define Risk: `Risk = Likelihood x Impact`.
*   Understand how CTI changes the "Likelihood" variable.
*   Calculate Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE).

## 2. Core Content

### The Equation
CTI generally does not change *Impact* (Cost of a breach). CTI changes *Likelihood* (Probability of a breach).

### FAIR Model (Simplified)
Risk is derived from:
1.  **Threat Event Frequency (TEF):** How often will they attack? (CTI provides this).
2.  **Vulnerability:** How likely are they to succeed? (Red Team/Vuln Mgmt provides this).
3.  **Loss Magnitude:** How much will it cost? (Business provides this).

### CTI's Role
*   **Without CTI:** "We should patch everything."
*   **With CTI:** "We prioritize patching Apache Struts because Threat Intel shows Actively Exploited in the Wild by Actors targeting our sector."

## 3. Lab: The Calculation

### Scenario
*   Asset: Database ($1M value).
*   Vulnerability: Unpatched SQLi.
*   **Baseline:** SQLi attacks happen once every 10 years. Risk = Low.

**New Intel:**
"New Worm 'SQL-Eater' is scanning the entire internet for this vulnerability at 1,000 requests/second."

**Recalculation:**
*   **Threat Event Frequency:** Increases from 0.1/year to 100/day.
*   **Risk:** SKYROCKETS.
*   **Decision:** Emergency Patch.

## 4. Reflection
1.  Why does CTI rarely affect "Loss Magnitude"? (The value of the data doesn't change just because a Russian is stealing it vs a Chinese actor).
2.  What is the difference between specific threat and aggregate threat? (Specific: APT29. Aggregate: "Commodity Malware").
