# Incident Response Lifecycle

## 1. Unit Brief: Organizing Chaos
When a breach happens, panic is the enemy. The Incident Response (IR) Lifecycle provides a structured framework to handle the crisis calmly and effectively.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Unstructured Response**: "Unplug everything! Format the servers!" (Destroys evidence, causes huge downtime, might not eject hacker).
*   **Structured Response**: "Isolate infected host. Analyze malware. Identifty Patient Zero. close vulnerability. Restore services."

## 3. Core Concepts

### PICERL (The NIST Framework)
1.  **Preparation**: Policies, Tools, Playbooks. (Before the hack).
2.  **Identification**: "Is this an incident?" Triage.
3.  **Containment**: Stop the bleeding. (Isolate).
4.  **Eradication**: Remove the root cause (Malware/Account).
5.  **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal.
6.  **Lessons Learned**: Post-Mortem. How to prevent next time.

## 4. Practical Examples

### Phase 1: Prep
*   Do we have a call list? Who calls Legal? Who calls PR?
*   Do we have reliable backups?

### Phase 3: Containment
*   **Short Term**: Disconnect network cable.
*   **Long Term**: Rebuild the compromised subnet.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Skipping Lessons Learned**: "Phew, it's over. Let's get back to work." If you don't learn, you will be hacked again by the same method next week.
*   **Rebooting**: Rebooting destroys RAM evidence. Do not reboot until forensics is done!

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Follow the Plan**: When adrenaline is high, IQ is low. Follow the checklist.
*   **Communication**: IR is 50% technical, 50% communication.
