# Memory Forensics

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers **Volatile Memory (RAM)**. The state of the machine *right now*.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Fileless malware exists only in RAM. Encryption keys exist only in RAM. If you don't look here, you miss the advanced threats.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Dump Files**.
*   **Volatility** (The Framework).
*   **Process Trees** in memory.

## 2. Core Content

### Why RAM?
*   **Network Connections**: Closed connections are gone from Netstat, but artifacts remain in RAM structures.
*   **injected Code**: DLLs hidden in other processes.
*   **Passwords**: Mimikatz finds cleartext passwords here.

### The Tool: Volatility
A python framework to parse the raw blob of RAM.
*   `vol.py -f dump.mem windows.pslist` (List processes).
*   `vol.py -f dump.mem windows.netscan` (List connections).

## 3. Guided Practice

### Finding the Evil Process
**Scenario**: You have a memory dump of an infected PC.

**Command**: `pslist`
*   You see `svchost.exe` with PID 400.
*   Parent PID is 2000 (`explorer.exe`).
*   *Verdict*: Evil. Real `svchost` parent is `services.exe`.

**Command**: `malfind` (Malware Find)
*   Scans for hidden code injection (RWX permissions).
*   *Result*: Found Shellcode in PID 400.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Hibernation File**: `hiberfil.sys`. (It's a copy of RAM on disk. Free massive memory dump for forensics!).
2.  **Updates**: Why does Volatility break on new Windows versions? (Because Microsoft changes the memory structures (KPCR) every patch. Finding the profile is hard).
3.  **Encrypted RAM**: Some modern CPUs encrypt RAM. (Makes offline analysis harder without the key).

---

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You understand that RAM contains the "Truth" of the running system.
2.  You know the tool **Volatility**.
3.  You can spot process anomalies in a list.
