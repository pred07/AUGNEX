# Offensive Security Roles Overview

## 1. Unit Brief: The Human Element of Attack
Before you touch a single tool or run a single exploit, you must understand **who** you are in the ecosystem. "Hacker" is a broad term. In the professional world, offensive security is divided into distinct roles, each with specific goals, constraints, and mindsets. Understanding these distinctions is critical for your career path and for legal safety.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
In a real engagement, knowing your role defines your limits.
*   **Penetration Tester**: You find vulnerabilities to fix them.
*   **Red Teamer**: You simulate a specific adversary to test the Blue Team's response.
*   **Bug Bounty Hunter**: You search for vulnerabilities in specified scopes for profit.
*   **Black Hat**: You break laws for personal gain (we do NOT do this).

Confusing these roles can lead to scope creep, legal trouble, or failed objectives.

## 3. Core Concepts

### The Color Spectrum

*   **Result**: The defender (Blue) improves their detection and response capabilities based on the attacker's (Red) actions. The goal is mutual improvement.

### The "Hat" Terminology
While "Hacker" is the umbrella term, the "Hat" denotes intent:

1.  **White Hat**: Ethical hackers. Authorized, legal, good intent. (You are here).
2.  **Grey Hat**: Ambiguous. May hack without permission but discloses vulnerabilities responsibly. **Still illegal** in many jurisdictions.
3.  **Black Hat**: Malicious. Hacking for theft, damage, or chaos. Illegal.

### Professional Roles

#### Penetration Tester
*   **Goal**: Find as many vulnerabilities as possible within a given timebox.
*   **Style**: Noisy. You want to find everything, even if you set off alarms.
*   **Output**: A report detailing vulnerabilities and remediation.

#### Red Teamer
*   **Goal**: Test the organization's detection and response capabilities.
*   **Style**: Stealthy. You want to avoid detection. Getting "caught" means the Blue Team wins that round.
*   **Output**: A timeline of the attack and an analysis of where the defense succeeded or failed.

## 4. Practical Examples

### Scenario: The Scope Difference

**Situation**: You find a SQL Injection in a login page.

*   **As a Pentester**: You confirm it, document it, and move on to find XSS on the next page. You might run `sqlmap` to prove severity.
*   **As a Red Teamer**: You use that SQL Injection quietly to extract a single admin password, log in, and move laterally to the domain controller, trying to remain unseen by the SOC (Security Operations Center).

### Terminal Context: Who am I?
While not an exploit, `id` and `whoami` are often the first commands run on a compromised system to understand your privilege level.

```bash
$ id
uid=1000(user) gid=1000(user) groups=1000(user),27(sudo)
```

*   **Interpretation**: You are a standard user (`uid=1000`) but belonging to the `sudo` group, meaning you can elevate privileges.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Acting like a Red Teamer during a Pentest**: Wasting time trying to be "stealthy" when the client just wants a list of bugs.
*   **Scope Creep**: Attacking systems that often "look" related but strictly aren't in the contract.
*   ** ignoring "Low" Severity Bugs**: In a pentest, even small info leaks matter.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Intent defines the hat**: Authorization is the difference between a job and a jail sentence.
*   **Know your role**: Are you there to find *all* bugs (Pentest) or to test *response* (Red Team)?
*   **Ethics**: Always operate within the agreed scope.
