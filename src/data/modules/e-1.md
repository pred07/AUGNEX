# Offensive Security Roles Overview

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module defines the **identity** of offensive security practitioners. Understanding your role is not about ego—it's about knowing your constraints, your legal boundaries, your deliverables, and your value to the client. The distinction between penetration testing, red teaming, vulnerability assessment, and bug bounty hunting determines everything from scope to methodology to legal protection.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Before learning *how* to compromise systems, you must understand *why* you're doing it and *what role* you're fulfilling. Your role dictates:
- What you're authorized to do
- How deep you go vs how wide you scan
- Whether you prioritize stealth or coverage
- What your deliverables look like

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will:
*   Distinguish between Penetration Testing, Red Teaming, Vulnerability Assessment, and Bug Bounty programs
*   Understand the "Hat" spectrum and why intent + authorization define legality
*   Recognize the business context that determines which engagement type is appropriate
*   Identify the career implications of each specialization

## 2. Core Content

### Mental Model: The Offensive Security Spectrum

**How professionals think about this:**
Offensive security is not a single discipline—it's a spectrum from **coverage-focused** (find everything) to **objective-focused** (achieve a specific goal). Your position on this spectrum determines your approach, tooling, and success criteria.

```
Vulnerability Assessment ←→ Penetration Testing ←→ Red Team ←→ Adversary Simulation
     (Coverage)                                                        (Realism)
```

Each step toward "realism" adds constraints: stealth requirements, time pressure, reduced scope visibility. Each step toward "coverage" reduces realism but increases completeness.

### The "Hat" Classification

The hat terminology is simplistic but foundational:

| Hat | Authorization | Intent | Legal Status |
|-----|---------------|--------|--------------|
| **White Hat** | Explicit written authorization | Improve security | Legal |
| **Grey Hat** | None or ambiguous | Improve security | **Illegal** |
| **Black Hat** | None | Malicious | Illegal |

**Critical insight:** Intent is irrelevant to legality. If you access a system without authorization, you have committed a crime in most jurisdictions—regardless of whether you "meant well." Grey hat activity has ended careers and resulted in prosecutions.

**Real-world example:** In 2013, Andrew Auernheimer (weev) was convicted under the CFAA for accessing AT&T's iPad customer data through a publicly accessible URL. Despite not "hacking" in the traditional sense, he accessed data without authorization. The conviction was later overturned on jurisdictional grounds, but the prosecution demonstrated that "I just found it" is not a defense.

### Core Offensive Security Roles

#### 1. Vulnerability Assessment (VA)
**Objective:** Identify known vulnerabilities across a broad scope.

**Characteristics:**
- Primarily automated scanning (Nessus, Qualys, OpenVAS)
- Minimal exploitation—detection only
- High coverage, low depth
- Often continuous/scheduled

**Deliverable:** A list of CVEs and misconfigurations with severity ratings.

**When appropriate:**
- Compliance requirements (PCI-DSS quarterly scans)
- Baseline security posture assessment
- Pre-acquisition due diligence

**Limitation:** VAs find what scanners know about. Novel vulnerabilities, logic flaws, and chained attacks are invisible.

#### 2. Penetration Testing
**Objective:** Validate vulnerabilities through actual exploitation and assess real-world impact.

**Characteristics:**
- Combination of automated and manual testing
- **Exploitation required**—proving vulnerabilities are real
- Time-boxed (typically 1-4 weeks)
- Defined scope (specific networks, applications, or systems)
- **Loud by design**—coverage over stealth

**Deliverable:** Technical report with exploited vulnerabilities, evidence (screenshots, data samples), and remediation guidance.

**When appropriate:**
- Validating VA findings before remediation
- Testing new applications before production
- Annual security assessments

**The pentester's dilemma:** Clients want comprehensive coverage, but time constraints force prioritization. A good pentester knows when to go deep on a promising attack vector vs when to move on for coverage.

#### 3. Red Team Operations
**Objective:** Achieve specific objectives while evading detection, testing both technical controls and human response.

**Characteristics:**
- **Objective-based, not coverage-based** (e.g., "access the CEO's inbox," "exfiltrate customer data")
- Stealth is mandatory—triggering alerts means mission compromise
- Extended duration (weeks to months)
- Tests the entire security program: controls, people, processes
- Often includes physical and social engineering

**Deliverable:** Narrative report of the attack path, gaps in detection/response, and strategic recommendations.

**When appropriate:**
- Mature security programs (you need something to test)
- Testing SOC/IR capabilities
- Executive-level risk demonstration

**Critical distinction:** A penetration test asks "Can this be exploited?" A red team engagement asks "Can your security program detect and stop a motivated attacker?"

#### 4. Purple Team Exercises
**Objective:** Collaborative testing where offense and defense work together.

**Characteristics:**
- Red team executes attacks while blue team observes
- Immediate feedback loop: "We did X, did you detect it?"
- Focus on improving detection, not proving weakness
- Not adversarial—cooperative improvement

**When appropriate:**
- Building detection capabilities
- Training SOC analysts
- Validating detection rules

#### 5. Bug Bounty Hunting
**Objective:** Find high-impact vulnerabilities in exchange for monetary rewards.

**Characteristics:**
- **Crowdsourced** offensive testing
- Hunters choose their own scope (within program rules)
- Payment only for valid, impactful findings
- Competitive—duplicates receive nothing
- No guaranteed deliverable or compensation

**When appropriate:**
- Continuous security testing at scale
- Accessing diverse attacker perspectives
- Supplementing internal testing

**Career reality:** Bug bounty is highly competitive. Top earners make significant income, but the median earnings are low. Treat it as skill development, not primary income, until you're established.

### Business Context: Why Clients Choose Each Type

| Scenario | Appropriate Engagement |
|----------|----------------------|
| "We need to pass our PCI audit" | Vulnerability Assessment |
| "Test our new customer portal before launch" | Penetration Test |
| "Would our SOC detect nation-state tactics?" | Red Team |
| "Help our blue team improve detection" | Purple Team |
| "We want ongoing community-driven testing" | Bug Bounty Program |

### The Authorization Imperative

**Legal protection requires:**
1. **Signed Statement of Work (SOW)** or **Rules of Engagement (ROE)**
2. **Clear scope definition** (in-scope/out-of-scope assets)
3. **Emergency contact information** for critical issues
4. **Time windows** for testing
5. **Authorization from someone with authority** (not just IT—legal/executive approval)

**What breaks down:**
- Scope documents that don't match reality (IP ranges changed)
- Third-party assets in the scope (cloud providers, CDNs)
- "Gentleman's agreement" authorizations without signatures
- Testing production systems without incident coordination

## 3. Guided Practice

### Exercise 1: Role Identification

Read each scenario and identify the most appropriate offensive security role:

**Scenario A:**
"Our board requested proof that our security investments are working. They want to see if an attacker could access patient records from the internet."
- **Role:** _____________
- **Reasoning:** _____________

**Scenario B:**
"We're deploying 500 new Windows servers. We need to verify they meet our hardening standards before production."
- **Role:** _____________
- **Reasoning:** _____________

**Scenario C:**
"Our SOC claims they can detect lateral movement. We want to validate this claim without telling them when we'll attack."
- **Role:** _____________
- **Reasoning:** _____________

### Exercise 2: Scope Analysis

Review this scope statement and identify potential problems:

```
SCOPE: All company-owned IT assets
OBJECTIVE: Identify critical vulnerabilities
TIMEFRAME: January 15-30
AUTHORIZATION: IT Director signature
```

**What's missing or ambiguous?**

## 4. Reflection Check

### Strategic Thinking
1. A company has never had a pentest before. Their security program is immature. They ask for a "red team engagement." What would you advise?

2. During a penetration test, you discover a critical vulnerability that could be exploited by ransomware. The scope says "identification only, no exploitation." What do you do?

3. You're a bug bounty hunter who finds a vulnerability. Before you can report it, the company releases a blog post saying they fixed that exact vulnerability and thanking their "internal security team." What happened? What should you have done?

### Career Considerations
1. Which role requires the deepest technical skills: VA, Pentest, or Red Team?
2. Which role requires the best communication and writing skills?
3. Which role has the most variable income?

## 5. Key Misconceptions

**MYTH: "Pentesters just run automated tools"**
REALITY: That's vulnerability assessment. Pentesters manually exploit vulnerabilities and chain them into attack paths.

**MYTH: "Red teams try to find every vulnerability"**
REALITY: Red teams achieve objectives. They may ignore 50 vulnerabilities if one path achieves the goal stealthily.

**MYTH: "Bug bounty is easy money"**
REALITY: Competition is fierce. Duplicates pay nothing. Most hunters earn less than minimum wage for their time.

**MYTH: "Grey hat is okay if you report the bug"**
REALITY: Unauthorized access is a crime. Reporting doesn't retroactively grant authorization.

**MYTH: "Authorization from IT is sufficient"**
REALITY: You need authorization from someone with legal authority over the assets—often requiring executive or legal sign-off.
