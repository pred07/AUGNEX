# Offensive Security Roles Overview

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module defines the identity of the attacker. We break down the distinctions between **Penetration Testers**, **Red Teamers**, and **Bug Bounty Hunters**.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Before you learn *how* to hack, you must define *why* you are hacking. Your role dictates your constraints, your goals, and your legal protection.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   The **White / Grey / Black** Hat spectrum.
*   The difference between finding bugs (Pentest) and simulating adversaries (Red Team).
*   Why intent is the only difference between a job and a crime.

## 2. Core Content

### The "Hat" Terminology
*   **White Hat**: Valid Authorization. Good Intent. (You are here).
*   **Grey Hat**: No Authorization. Good Intent. (Illegal).
*   **Black Hat**: No Authorization. Bad Intent. (Illegal).

### Professional Roles
1.  **Penetration Tester**:
    *   **Goal**: Find *all* vulnerabilities in a specific system.
    *   **Style**: Loud, comprehensive.
    *   **Analogy**: A building inspector checking every door and window.

2.  **Red Teamer**:
    *   **Goal**: Achieve a specific objective (e.g., "Steal the CEO's email").
    *   **Style**: Stealthy, targeted.
    *   **Analogy**: A ninja trying to sneak in without tripping the alarm.

3.  **Bug Bounty Hunter**:
    *   **Goal**: Find high-impact bugs for cash.
    *   **Style**: Opportunistic, creative.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Identifying the Role
Read the scenario and decide which role fits best.

**Scenario A**:
"Client wants a report of every outdated server in their network by Friday."
*   **Role**: Penetration Tester.

**Scenario B**:
"Client wants to know if their SOC (Security Operations Center) can detect a ransomware attack."
*   **Role**: Red Teamer.

**Scenario C**:
"You found a bug in Uber's app and submitted it via HackerOne."
*   **Role**: Bug Bounty Hunter.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Ethics**: Why is "Grey Hat" hacking considered dangerous, even if you mean well? (Because you touched a system without permission. You don't know if your scan caused a crash).
2.  **Career**: Which role appeals to you more? The puzzle-solving coverage of Pentesting, or the spy-thriller stealth of Red Teaming?
3.  **Conflict**: Why might a Sysadmin hate a Pentester during a test? (Because you are generating alerts and potentially breaking things they have to fix).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can explain why a Red Team engagement lasts months, while a Pentest lasts weeks.
2.  You understand that **Authorization** is the boundary of legality.
3.  You have chosen a mental "Role" to adopt for this course.
