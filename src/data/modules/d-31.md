# Digital Forensics Fundamentals

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers **CSI: Cyber**. How to handle evidence without destroying it.

### Fit in the Learning Path
You responded to the incident (d-30). Now you need to take the hard drive to court.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Order of Volatility**.
*   **Chain of Custody**.
*   **Locard's Exchange Principle**.

## 2. Core Content

### Order of Volatility
Gather the most fleeting data first.
1.  **CPU Cache / Registers** (Gone in nanoseconds).
2.  **RAM** (Gone on reboot).
3.  **Network State** (Gone quickly).
4.  **Disk** (Persistent).
5.  **Backups** (Archival).

### Chain of Custody
A paper log. "Officer A took drive at 10:00. Officer B Locked it in safe at 10:15."
*   If there is a gap, the evidence is inadmissible in court.

### Locard's Exchange Principle
"Every contact leaves a trace." You cannot enter a system without changing it (Timestamp updates, Logs).

## 3. Guided Practice

### The Write Blocker
**Concept**: A hardware device.
**Usage**: You plug the suspect drive into the Write Blocker, then into your PC.
**Result**: Your PC can *Read* the drive, but physically cannot *Write* to it.
*   *Why?* Proven integrity. You didn't accidentally change the "Last Access Time" attribute.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Live Forensics**: Why do we sometimes ignore "Pull the Plug"? (Because encryption keys are in RAM. If you pull the plug, the disk locks forever. We need to scrape RAM first).
2.  **Hash**: Why hash the image immediately? (To prove later that the copy is identical to the original).
3.  **Bias**: Forensics is about finding the truth, not finding guilt. (Exculpatory evidence is just as important).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You memorize the **Order of Volatility**.
2.  You respect the **Chain of Custody**.
3.  You understand why **Write Blockers** are mandatory for legal cases.
