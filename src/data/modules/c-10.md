# Control Ownership and Responsibility

## 1. What this module covers
The human side of controls. Who owns the WAF? Who owns the EDR policy? Who fixes it when it breaks?

## 2. Why this matters for purple teams
Technically, the WAF works. Operationally, nobody looked at the logs for 6 months because "Bob left and nobody took over."

## 3. Core concepts explained clearly

### RACI Matrix
*   **Responsible**: Who does the work? (Engineer).
*   **Accountable**: Who gets fired if it fails? (CISO/Manager).
*   **Consulted**: Who needs to know? (App Team).
*   **Informed**: Who is told after? (SOC).

### The "Default Secure" Problem
*   DevOps spawns a new server.
*   Security assumes DevOps hardened it.
*   DevOps assumes Security hardened it.
*   **Result**: Nobody hardened it.

## 4. Validation examples

### The Fire Drill
*   **Scenario**: WAF is blocking legitimate traffic.
*   **Test**: Call the "WAF Owner" number in the wiki.
*   **Result**: "This number is disconnected." -> **Process Failure**.

### Ownership Audit
*   List top 10 security tools.
*   List the Primary and Backup Admin for each.
*   If any are "TBD" or "Vendor Support Only", that is a risk.

## 5. Common gaps and failures
*   **Shared Responsibility (Cloud)**: "AWS secures the cloud." Yes, but YOU secure the data IN the cloud. Misunderstanding this causes S3 leaks.
*   **Vendor Reliance**: "The vendor monitors it." (But do they understand your business context?).

## 6. Key takeaways
*   **Names**: Every control must have a human name attached to it.
*   **Coverage**: Tool ownership must be part of the job description, not a side hobby.
