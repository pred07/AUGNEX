# Control Ownership and Responsibility

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers the organizational dynamics of security control ownership—who finds issues, who fixes them, and who is accountable. Understanding RACI and cross-team collaboration is essential for effective security outcomes.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Finding vulnerabilities is only half the work. Getting them fixed requires navigating organizational complexity—security teams identify, operations teams implement, business teams accept risk. Purple teaming bridges these silos.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will:
*   Apply RACI matrices to security tasks
*   Navigate security vs operations conflicts
*   Facilitate remediation across teams
*   Track remediation effectiveness

## 2. Core Content

### Mental Model: The Three Domains

**How professionals think about this:**
Security problems exist at the intersection of three domains: Security (who finds), Operations (who fixes), and Business (who owns the risk). Each speaks a different language and has different incentives. Purple team bridges these gaps.

```
THE SECURITY TRIANGLE:

                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │    BUSINESS     │
                    │                 │
                    │  Owns the risk  │
                    │  Controls budget│
                    │  Makes decisions│
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
              "Is this risk  │  "How much does
               acceptable?"  │   this cost?"
                             │
         ┌───────────────────┴───────────────────┐
         │                                       │
         ▼                                       ▼
┌─────────────────┐                   ┌─────────────────┐
│    SECURITY     │                   │   OPERATIONS    │
│                 │                   │                 │
│  Finds the risk │◄─────────────────►│  Owns the asset │
│  Assesses impact│  "This needs to  │  Applies changes│
│  Recommends fix │   be fixed"      │  Maintains uptime│
└─────────────────┘                   └─────────────────┘
                    
                  vs
         "Patch now!"        "Can't, it'll break production"

         PURPLE TEAM BRIDGES THIS GAP:
         "Here's the risk demonstrated.
          Here are options including compensating controls.
          Here's how to test safely."
```

### RACI Framework

**Defining accountability:**

```
RACI DEFINITIONS:

R = RESPONSIBLE
    Who does the work?
    The person/team that performs the task

A = ACCOUNTABLE
    Who is ultimately answerable?
    Only one person—the decision maker
    
C = CONSULTED
    Whose input is needed?
    Two-way communication before decision

I = INFORMED
    Who needs to know?
    One-way communication after decision

EXAMPLE: CRITICAL VULNERABILITY PATCHING

Task                    Security  IT Ops  Dev Team  CISO  Business
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Identify vulnerability     R         I       I       I       I
Assess risk               R/A        I       C       I       I
Approve remediation        C         C       C       A       C
Develop/test patch         I        R/A      C       I       I
Apply patch                I         R       C       A       I
Verify remediation         R         I       I       A       I
Accept residual risk       C         C       C       C      R/A
```

### The Conflict Dynamic

**Understanding competing priorities:**

| Team | Primary Goal | Security View | Conflict |
|------|--------------|---------------|----------|
| **Security** | Reduce risk | Priority #1 | "Business ignores us" |
| **Operations** | Maintain uptime | Necessary evil | "Security creates work" |
| **Development** | Ship features | Slows us down | "Security is a blocker" |
| **Business** | Revenue | Cost center | "Security is expensive" |

```
THE CLASSIC CONFLICT:

Security: "This critical vulnerability must be patched immediately"
          │
          ▼
Operations: "We can't patch this system. The legacy app breaks"
            │
            ▼
Business: "That app generates $10M/month. Don't break it"
          │
          ▼
Security: "But we could be breached!"
          │
          ▼
Business: "What's the actual risk? Show me."
          │
          ▼
THIS IS WHERE PURPLE TEAM ADDS VALUE:

Purple Team: "We successfully exploited this vulnerability.
             Here is the demonstrated impact:
             - Full system compromise in 5 minutes
             - Access to connected systems
             - Potential data breach
             
             Options:
             1. Patch (requires 4-hour maintenance window)
             2. Network isolation (reduces risk 80%)
             3. Virtual patch via WAF (reduces risk 60%)
             4. Accept risk (document decision)
             
             Recommendation: Option 2 now, Option 1 during 
             scheduled maintenance next week"
```

### Effective Handoffs

**Security ticket quality:**

```
BAD HANDOFF:
─────────────────────────────
"Vulnerability CVE-2024-1234 found on SERVER-01. Please fix."

Result: Operations has no context, no priority, no guidance
        Ticket sits in backlog for months

GOOD HANDOFF:
─────────────────────────────
TITLE: CRITICAL: RCE in Apache Struts (CVE-2024-1234) - SERVER-01

PRIORITY: Critical (actively exploited in the wild)

AFFECTED: SERVER-01 (Production Web Server)
          Apache Struts 2.5.30

IMPACT: Remote code execution without authentication
        Demonstrated: Purple team achieved full server compromise
        Business: Hosts customer payment portal

FIX: Upgrade Apache Struts to 2.5.33
     Patch available: [link]
     Testing required: [test cases]

ALTERNATIVE (if patch not immediately possible):
     WAF rule to block exploitation: [rule ID]
     Network restriction: Block external access to management port

DEADLINE: 48 hours (compensating control)
          7 days (full patch)

VERIFICATION: Security team will re-test after remediation
              Contact: security@company.com

Result: Clear, actionable, prioritized, with alternatives
```

### Tracking Remediation

**Metrics that matter:**

```
REMEDIATION METRICS:

MEAN TIME TO REMEDIATE (MTTR):
─────────────────────────────
Time from issue identification to fix verified

Critical: Target < 7 days
High: Target < 30 days
Medium: Target < 90 days
Low: Target < 180 days

REMEDIATION RATE:
─────────────────────────────
Issues fixed / Issues identified × 100

Target: > 95% for Critical/High
        > 80% for Medium
        
AGE ANALYSIS:
─────────────────────────────
How many vulnerabilities older than SLA?
Growing = Problem
Shrinking = Improvement

RECURRENCE RATE:
─────────────────────────────
Issues that return after "fixed"
High = Bad fixes or systemic problem

TRACKING DASHBOARD:

│ Category   │ Total │ Open │ > SLA │ Trend │
├────────────┼───────┼──────┼───────┼───────┤
│ Critical   │  12   │   2  │   0   │  ↓    │
│ High       │  89   │  23  │   5   │  ↓    │
│ Medium     │ 456   │ 178  │  45   │  →    │
│ Low        │ 1023  │ 560  │  89   │  ↑    │
```

### DevSecOps Integration

**Shifting ownership left:**

```
TRADITIONAL MODEL:
─────────────────────────────
Development → QA → Security Testing → Operations → Production

Security finds issues late → Expensive to fix
Ops owns remediation → Bottleneck

DEVSECOPS MODEL:
─────────────────────────────
Development + Security + Operations = DevSecOps

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                     │
│  Code Commit → SAST scan → Build → DAST scan → Deploy → Monitor   │
│       │            │          │         │          │         │     │
│       ▼            ▼          ▼         ▼          ▼         ▼     │
│    Secrets      Vulnerable  Container Security  Runtime           │
│    scanning     code found  image scan verified  protection       │
│                                                                     │
│  DEVELOPER OWNS SECURITY OF THEIR CODE                             │
│  Security team enables, consults, validates                        │
│                                                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

BENEFITS:
- Issues found early (cheaper to fix)
- Developers learn security
- Security scales with development
- Faster remediation cycles
```

### Compensating Controls

**When primary remediation isn't possible:**

| Situation | Primary Control | Compensating Control |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|
| Can't patch | Update software | WAF rule, network isolation |
| Can't disable service | Remove functionality | Additional monitoring |
| Can't encrypt | Encryption | Physical security, access controls |
| Can't enforce MFA | MFA everywhere | Risk-based auth, IP restrictions |
| Can't segment | Network segmentation | Enhanced endpoint detection |

## 3. Guided Practice

### Exercise 1: RACI Development

Create RACI for "Responding to a phishing incident":

| Task | Security | IT Ops | HR | Legal | Comms |
|------|----------|--------|-----|-------|-------|
| Detect incident | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |
| Contain threat | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |
| Notify affected users | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |
| Report to regulators | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |

### Exercise 2: Ticket Quality

Rewrite this bad ticket:
"SQL injection found. Fix it."

Improved ticket:
___

### Exercise 3: Conflict Resolution

Security says patch now. Ops says can't. Business says don't break revenue.

Your purple team facilitation approach:
1. ___
2. ___
3. ___

---

## 4. Reflection Check

### Organizational Understanding
1. Vulnerability is 6 months old. Who failed?

2. Dev team says "not a security issue." How to respond?

3. CISO wants 100% remediation. Operations wants stable systems. Balance?

### Practical Thinking
1. 500-vulnerability report delivered. Expected outcome?

2. Operations fixes issue. How to verify?

3. Business accepts risk for critical vulnerability. Your role?

---

## 5. Key Misconceptions

**MYTH: "Security's job ends at finding vulnerabilities"**
REALITY: Finding matters only if it leads to fixing. Remediation is the goal.

**MYTH: "Operations is the blocker"**
REALITY: Operations has legitimate constraints. Understanding them enables solutions.

**MYTH: "More detailed reports = better outcomes"**
REALITY: Prioritized, actionable guidance drives remediation. Volume overwhelms.

**MYTH: "Compensating controls are cheating"**
REALITY: Compensating controls are legitimate risk reduction when primary controls aren't feasible.

**MYTH: "DevSecOps means security does less"**
REALITY: DevSecOps means security enables more. The work shifts, doesn't disappear.
