# Control Ownership and Responsibility

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers **RACI** (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed). Who fixes the gap?

### Fit in the Learning Path
The Red Team finds a bug. The Blue Team detects it. Who *patches* it? (Usually IT Ops).

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **The Silos**: Security vs Operations.
*   **Handing off**: Ticket quality.
*   **Verification**.

## 2. Core Content

### The Triangle
1.  **Security (Finder)**: Identifies the risk.
2.  **Operations (Fixer)**: Owns the server/app. Applies the patch.
3.  **Business (Owner)**: Owns the risk/budget.

### The Conflict
*   Security: "Patch this now. It's critical."
*   Ops: "If I patch this, the legacy app breaks and the factory stops."
*   Business: "Don't stop the factory."

### Resolution
Purple Team facilitates this. "We successfully exploited this. Here is the impact. If we cannot patch, can we apply a Firewall rule (Compensating Control)?"

## 3. Guided Practice

### The RACI Matrix
**Task**: Patching Apache Struts.
*   **Responsible**: Server Admin (Tests and installs patch).
*   **Accountable**: CISO (If we get hacked).
*   **Consulted**: App Developer (Will this break code?).
*   **Informed**: SOC (Expect reboot alerts).

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Empathy**: Ops teams are overworked. Security dumping a 500-page PDF report on them is rude. (Prioritize Top 5 fixes).
2.  **Follow-up**: Did they actually fix it? (Re-scan/Re-test).
3.  **DevSecOps**: Moving ownership left. (Developers own the security of their code).

---

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You know that **Finding** a bug is only 50% of the work.
2.  You respect the **Operations** team constraints.
3.  You track "Mean Time to Remediate".
