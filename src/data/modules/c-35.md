# Turning Incidents into Improvements

## 1. What this module covers
The Post-Mortem (Lessons Learned). Converting pain into strength.

## 2. Why this matters for purple teams
Every incident (real or simulated) is a free penetration test. Don't waste the data.

## 3. Core concepts explained clearly

### The Feedback Loop
1.  **Incident**: Phishing -> Ransomware.
2.  **Root Cause**: User clicked link (Human error) AND EDR failed to block (Tech error).
3.  **Action Item**:
    *   Train User? (Low efficacy).
    *   Tune EDR? (High efficacy).
    *   Disable Macros? (Root fix).

### Purple Team Retrospective
*   After the exercise, sit down.
*   Red: "I used technique X."
*   Blue: "I saw Y."
*   **Fix**: "How do we see X next time?"

## 4. Validation examples

### The "Fix-It" Logic
*   **Incident**: Red Team dumped LSASS using `procdump`.
*   **Fix**: Enable "Block LSASS Access" rule in ASR (Attack Surface Reduction).
*   **Verification**: Red Team tries `procdump` again. It fails.
*   **Success**: The organization is permanently immune to that specific technique.

## 5. Common gaps and failures
*   **Blame Game**: "Who clicked the link?" (Useless). "Why was the link clickable?" (Useful).
*   **Reports filed & forgotten**: The Post-Mortem PDF is saved but nobody implements the fixes.

## 6. Key takeaways
*   **Never waste a crisis**: An incident allows you to push through changes (like disabling Macros) that were politically impossible before.
