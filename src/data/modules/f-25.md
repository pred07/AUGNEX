# Git, Version Control, and Tool Management

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module introduces **Git**. Not just for developers, but for security professionals. You need it to download tools, track your own scripts, and collaborate.

### Fit in the Learning Path
"Where do I get that exploit script?" GitHub. "how do I save my changes?" Git. It is the librarian of code.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Clone**: Downloading a repo.
*   **Pull**: Updating a repo.
*   The difference between `git` (The tool) and `GitHub` (The website).

## 2. Core Content

### Why Git?
Git is a distributed version control system.
1.  **History**: It saves every version of a file ever made.
2.  **Collaboration**: Multiple people can work on the same code without overwriting each other.
3.  **Distribution**: It is the standard way to share open-source security tools (Impacket, BloodHound, Metasploit).

### Analysis of a GitHub Repo
Before you run code, you must judge it.
*   **Stars**: Credibility.
*   **Issues**: Open bugs.
*   **Last Commit**: Is it dead? (Last update 2013 = Avoid).

## 3. Guided Practice

### Cloning a Tool
We will download a popular wordlist repository.

**Step 1: Install Git**
(It should be pre-installed on Kali).
```bash
git --version
```

**Step 2: Clone 'SecLists'**
This is a massive collection of usernames/passwords for testing.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists.git
```

**Step 3: Explore**
```bash
cd SecLists
ls
```

**Step 4: Update**
A month later, you want the new lists.
```bash
git pull
```

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Security**: If I clone a random repo and run `sudo python setup.py`, what did I just allow that stranger to do? (Execute code as Root on my machine).
2.  **OpSec**: If you find a bug in a target's website, and you post it as a "Issue" on their public GitHub, did you just disclose a vulnerability publicly? (Yes).
3.  **Forks**: Why do we often "Fork" a repo before modifying it? (To keep our own copy independent of the original author).

---

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You have successfully cloned a repository.
2.  You treat `git clone` as a potential security risk (vet the code!).
3.  You know how to update a tool using `git pull`.
