# Git, Version Control, and Tool Management

## Introduction

Hackers don't just use tools; they download them, modify them, and fix them. Most security tools live on **GitHub**. You need to know how to get them.

## Git Basics

**Git** is a version control system. It tracks changes in code.

1.  **`git clone [url]`**
    *   Example: `git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists.git`
    *   Downloads the entire repository to your machine.
2.  **`git pull`**
    *   Updates the tool if the author changed it.

## Managing Python Tools (pip)

Many tools are written in Python.
1.  **`pip install -r requirements.txt`**
    *   Installs the dependencies needed for the tool to run.
2.  **Virtual Environments (venv)**
    *   Isolating tools so they don't break your system python.
    *   `python3 -m venv myenv`

## Lab Hygiene (Again)

Organize your `/opt` or `/home/student/tools` directory.
*   `/tools/recon`
*   `/tools/exploitation`
*   `/tools/web`

Don't just download everything into one messy folder.

## Why This Matters

You will spend 20% of your time hacking and 80% of your time fixing broken tools. Being comfortable with Git and Pip is a survival skill.
