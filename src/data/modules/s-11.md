# Image & Geospatial Intelligence (IMINT/GEOINT)

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
Analyzing imagery to determine location, time, and hidden details. From analyzing a Ransomware actor's desktop screenshot to tracking troop movements via satellite imagery, or simply locating a rogue Wi-Fi access point.

### Learning Objectives
*   Perform **EXIF Data** analysis.
*   Use **Shadow Analysis** to determine time of day.
*   Leverage **Satellite Imagery** (Google Earth, Sentinel Hub).

---

## 2. Core Content

### 1. EXIF Data (Metadata)
Images taken by phones/cameras often contain:
*   **GPS Coordinates:** Latitude/Longitude.
*   **Device Info:** Make, Model, Software version.
*   **Timestamp:** Exact date/time.
*   **Cleaning:** Social media (Twitter/FB) strips EXIF. Direct uploads (blogs/forums) often keep it.
*   **Tool:** `exiftool`.

### 2. Visual Geolocation
Determining location by content.
*   **Landmarks:** Towers, Mountains, Signs.
*   **Infrastructure:** Plug sockets (Country), Road lines (Color/Pattern), Driving side.
*   **Shadows:** Suncalc.org. Using the length and angle of a shadow + date to determine time (Chronolocation) or location ranges.

### 3. Satellite Imagery
*   **Google Earth Pro:** Historical imagery slider (See a building being built).
*   **Sentinel Hub:** Lower resolution, but frequent updates (daily/weekly). Good for spotting large changes or fires.

### 4. Reverse Image Search (RIS)
*   **Yandex:** Best for faces and Russian/Eastern Euro context.
*   **Google Lens:** Best for objects (Plants, Cars, Products).
*   **TinEye:** Best for finding the "First" instance (Origin) of an image.

## 3. Lab: The Kidnapped CEO (Simulation)
**Intel:** Attackers post a proof-of-life photo of a hostage holding a newspaper.
1.  **Newspaper:** Headlines confirm the date. Language confirms region.
2.  **Window:** View outside shows a specific church steeple.
3.  **Sun:** Shadow angle suggests 10:00 AM.
4.  **Triangulation:** Search Google Earth for churches in that city oriented 10 degrees North...

## 4. Completion Criteria
1.  **Use** `exiftool` to extract GPS coordinates from a sample image.
2.  **Explain** why shadows help determine time of day.
3.  **Identify** which search engine is best for facial recognition (Yandex/Pimeyes).
