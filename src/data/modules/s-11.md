# Breach Data Analysis

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
"I've been pwned."Breach data (usernames, passwords, PII) is the fuel for credential stuffing and phishing. This module covers how to legally and ethically access breach repositories (DeHashed, HaveIBeenPwned) for defensive purposes.

### Learning Objectives
*   Search for compromised credentials securely.
*   Analyze password reuse patterns.
*   Understand the format of "Combo Lists".

## 2. Core Content

### The Ecosystem
1.  **Hack:** Site is breached.
2.  **Leak:** DB is sold on forums.
3.  **Aggregation:** Data is indexed by services (DeHashed, IntelX).
4.  **Reuse:** Attackers try the `email:pass` on banking sites.

### Formats
*   **SQL Dump:** Full database structure.
*   **Combo List:** `user@email.com:password123` (Processed for attackers).
*   **Hash:** `user:5f4dcc3b5aa...` (Needs cracking).

### Defense
If you find your CEO's password in a breach:
1.  **Verify:** Is the password still active?
2.  **Reset:** Force password change.
3.  **MFA:** Ensure 2FA is on.

## 3. Lab: The Breach Hunt

### Scenario
Investigate `target@company.com`.

1.  **HIBP:** `haveibeenpwned.com`. Result: "Found in Collection #1, LinkedIn 2016".
2.  **Analysis:** The user was exposed in 2016.
3.  **DeHashed (Simulation):** Search email.
    *   Result: `password: hunter2`.
4.  **Pivot:** Search for other accounts using `hunter2` (reverse search). Found personal hotmail account.

## 4. Reflection
1.  Why is "Password Reuse" the biggest risk? (One breach in a knitting forum can compromise a corporate bank account if the user reuses the password).
2.  What is "Credential Stuffing"? (Automated script trying millions of leaked user/pass combos against a login page).
