# Attribution: Science and Pitfalls

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
"Who did it?" The most dangerous question in Intel. Wrong attribution causes diplomatic incidents or massive legal waste. This module covers the **Confidence Matrix** and why Attribution is rarely needed for defense.

### Learning Objectives
*   Understand the **pyramid of attribution** (IP -> Persona -> Human -> State).
*   Recognize **False Flags**.
*   Define **Confidence Levels**.

## 2. Core Content

### The Attribution Layers
1.  **Technical:** This IP launched the attack. (Easy).
2.  **Persona:** "Guccifer 2.0" claims the attack. (Medium).
3.  **Affiliation:** "It aligns with Russian interests." (Hard).
4.  **Human:** "Ivan Ivanov at 14 KGB Street, Moscow." (Impossible without Law Enforcement/Spycraft).

### False Flags
*   **Definition:** An actor pretending to be someone else.
*   *Example:* The "Olympic Destroyer" malware contained code copied from North Korean malware to blame them, but it was actually Russia.
*   **Lesson:** Never trust metadata (Compililation timestamps, languages) blindly.

### Is Attribution Necessary?
*   **For Defense:** NO. Blocking the TTP stops the Chinese and the Russians equally.
*   **For Law Enforcement:** YES. To arrest.
*   **For Politics:** YES. To sanction.

## 3. Lab: The Olympic Destroyer Case Study
**Evidence:**
*   Code looked North Korean (Lazarus).
*   Target was South Korea (Lazarus motive).
*   **BUT:** The "North Korean" code was pasted perfectly, too perfectly.
*   **Analysis:** It was a deception.

## 4. Completion Criteria
1.  **Explain** "False Flag".
2.  **Argue** why a SOC analyst doesn't need to know *Who* attacked (only *How*).
