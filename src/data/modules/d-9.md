# Windows Logging Fundamentals

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers **Windows Event Logs**. The binary format (`.evtx`) and the Event Viewer tool.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Windows is the corporate standard. 90% of your targets will be Windows. You must speak "Event ID".

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Event Viewer**.
*   **Channels**: Application, Security, System.
*   **Key IDs**: 4624 (Login), 4625 (Fail).

---

## 2. Core Content

### The Structure
Windows logs are **Structured Data** (XML inside a binary wrapper).
*   **Provider**: Who created it? (Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing).
*   **EventID**: The unique code.
*   **Level**: Info, Warning, Error, Critical.

### The Big Three Channels
1.  **Security**: The most important. Tracks Auditing.
2.  **System**: Service Control Manager.
3.  **Application**: Crashes and app events.

### Critical Event IDs (Memorize These)
*   **4624**: Successful Logon. (Look for Logon Type 3 = Network, 10 = RDP).
*   **4625**: Failed Logon. (Brute Force).
*   **4720**: User Account Created. (Persistence).
*   **1102**: Audit Log Cleared. (Attacker covering tracks).

## 3. Guided Practice

### Event Viewer Drill
**Step 1**: Press `Win + R`, type `eventvwr`.
**Step 2**: Expand **Windows Logs** -> **Security**.
**Step 3**: Filter Current Log -> ID `4624`.
**Step 4**: Click an event. Look at the Details.
*   **Account Name**: Who?
*   **Source Network Address**: From where?

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Volume**: Why is the Security log circular? (Because it fills up fast. When full, it overwrites the oldest events. This is why we need to forward them to a SIEM).
2.  **Logon Types**: Why does Logon Type 3 (Network) happen 1000 times a day? (File share access, background Auth).
3.  **Sysmon**: What is Sysmon? (An extra, advanced tool from Microsoft that logs *Process Creations* and *DNS Queries*, which standard logs miss).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You have opened `eventvwr`.
2.  You verify that ID **4625** is a failed login.
3.  You understand that Windows logs are ephemeral (local) unless shipped.
