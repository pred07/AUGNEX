# Executive vs Technical Reporting

## 1. Unit Brief: Speak Two Languages
A Pentest Report has two audiences: The CTO/CEO (who signs the check) and the Developer (who fixes the bug). You need two separate sections.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **CEO reads**: "We have 3 Criticals. We are likely to be hacked. Fix cost: $5k." (Decision: Approve).
*   **Dev reads**: "Sanitization failed on line 55 of `login.php`. Escape the `user` variable." (Action: Fix).

## 3. Core Concepts

### Executive Summary
*   No jargon (No "XSS", "SQLi").
*   Use Charts (Pie chart of risk).
*   Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF): "Are we secure? No."
*   Strategic Recommendations: "Invest in WAF," "Train developers."

### Technical Report
*   Full technical detail.
*   HTTP Requests/Responses.
*   Code snippets.
*   CVE references.

## 4. Practical Examples

### Executive Translation
*   **Technical**: "Blind SQL Injection in `id` parameter allowing data exfiltration."
*   **Executive**: "A flaw in the website allows attackers to steal the entire customer database, leading to potential GDPR fines."

### The "Good News" Sandwich
Executives panic. Give them context.
"While we found critical flaws in the web app, your internal network defenses successfully detected and blocked our lateral movement attempts."

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Tech in Exec Summary**: Putting a screenshot of Burp Suite in the Executive Summary. (Instant fail).
*   **Fear Mongering**: "You WILL be hacked." Instead say: "The risk of compromise is high."

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Know your audience**: Don't bore the Dev with business costs. Don't bore the CEO with HTTP headers.
*   **Professional Tone**: Objective, not emotional.
