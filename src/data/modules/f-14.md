# Linux Command Line Essentials

## Introduction

The **Terminal** (CLI - Command Line Interface) is faster, more powerful, and more precise than the GUI (Graphical User Interface). To be a hacker is to live in the terminal.

## Core Navigation

Open your Kali terminal and try these:

1.  **`pwd`** (Print Working Directory)
    *   Where am I?
2.  **`ls`** (List)
    *   What is here?
    *   Try `ls -la` (List all, including hidden files, with details).
3.  **`cd`** (Change Directory)
    *   Move around.
    *   `cd Downloads` (Go to Downloads).
    *   `cd ..` (Go up one level).
    *   `cd ~` (Go home).

## Reading Files

1.  **`cat`** (Concatenate)
    *   Show content immediately. `cat file.txt`.
2.  **`less`**
    *   Read large files page by page. Press `q` to quit.
3.  **`head`** / **`tail`**
    *   Show only the first 10 or last 10 lines.

## Creating Things

1.  **`touch file.txt`**: Creates an empty file.
2.  **`mkdir NewFolder`**: Creates a directory.

## Getting Help

If you forget what a command does, ask the manual:
*   `man ls`

## Why This Matters

Real servers (like the ones running Amazon/Google) often DO NOT HAVE A GUI. You connect via SSH and all you get is a blinking cursor. You must be comfortable here.
