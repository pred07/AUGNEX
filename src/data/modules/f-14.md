# Linux Command Line Essentials

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers navigation. How to move around the filesystem without a mouse.

### Fit in the Learning Path
You cannot hack if you cannot move. These commands (`cd`, `ls`, `pwd`) are the muscle memory of every security professional.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   Absolute vs Relative paths.
*   The significance of `.` (Current) and `..` (Parent).
*   How to list hidden files.

---

## 2. Core Content

### The Tree Structure
Linux uses a single hierarchical tree, starting at Root (`/`).
*   `/`: The start.
*   `/home/user`: Your house.
*   `/etc`: Configuration files.
*   `/bin`: Binaries (Programs).

### The Big Three
1.  **pwd** (Print Working Directory): "Where am I?"
2.  **ls** (List): "What is here?"
3.  **cd** (Change Directory): "Go there."

### Pathing Logic
*   **Absolute**: Starts with `/`. (e.g., `cd /var/log`). "Teleportation".
*   **Relative**: Relative to where you are. (e.g., `cd log`). "Walking".

## 3. Guided Practice

### Navigation Drill
Perform this sequence exactly.

**Step 1: Check Location**
```bash
pwd
```
(Likely `/home/kali`).

**Step 2: Go to Root**
```bash
cd /
pwd
```

**Step 3: List Everything (Detailed)**
```bash
ls -la
```
*   `-l`: Long format (Permissions, Size).
*   `-a`: All (Show hidden files starting with `.`).

**Step 4: Relative Jump**
Go to `etc`, then go back.
```bash
cd etc
pwd
cd ..
pwd
```
(You should be back at `/`).

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Hidden Files**: Why do hackers hide their tools in directories starting with `.`? (Because `ls` hides them by default).
2.  **Root Directory**: Why can't a standard user create a folder in `/`? (Permissions: Root owns `/`).
3.  **Tilde**: What does `cd ~` do? (Shortcut home).

---

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can navigate to `/tmp` and back to `~`.
2.  You use `ls -la` by default instead of just `ls`.
3.  You understand the difference between `.` and `..`.
