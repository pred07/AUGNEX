# Understanding Exposure and Misconfiguration

## 1. Unit Brief: The Open Doors
Exposure is when sensitive data or services are visible to the public internet when they shouldn't be. Misconfiguration is when a service is installed but security settings were left at "Default" (insecure). Together, these account for the vast majority of easy hacks.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
Zero-day exploits are rare. Finding an S3 bucket with "public read" access containing 10,000 customer records is dangerously common. You don't need to be a coding genius to hack this; you just need to look.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Cloud Misconfigurations
*   **S3 Buckets**: Storage containers often left open.
*   **Permissive IAM Roles**: Giving a user `AdministratorAccess` when they only needed `Read-Only`.
*   **Security Groups**: Allowing SSH (Port 22) from `0.0.0.0/0` (The whole world).

### Development Leftovers
*   **.git folders**: If you upload the `.git` folder to the web server, anyone can download your entire source code history.
*   **Backup files**: `config.php.bak`, `db.sql.gz`.

### Default Credentials
*   **router / admin**
*   **admin / password**
*   **tomcat / s3cret**
Looking up "Default passwords for [Software X]" is a valid attack step.

## 4. Practical Examples

### The `.git` exposure
If you navigate to `http://target.com/.git/HEAD` and file a file, you can often use tools like `git-dumper` to reconstruct the whole repo.
*   **Impact**: Full source code theft -> Finding hardcoded secrets.

### S3 Enum
Tools like `cloud_enum` can guess bucket names based on the company name.
*   `company-backup`
*   `company-dev`
*   `company-logs`
If one returns "ListBucketResult", you win.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Overlooking 403 Forbidden**: Sometimes a 403 on `/admin` is good—it means `/admin` exists. Now try `/admin/login` or methods to bypass the 403.
*   **Focusing only on Custom Code**: Focusing on the custom web app logic while ignoring that the server is running an ancient, default-config Jenkins instance on Port 8080.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Defaults are Dangerous**: Always change default passwords and settings.
*   **Clean Up**: Delete backup files and `.git` folders from production.
*   **Cloud Awareness**: The cloud is just someone else's computer that you configure poorly.
