# Understanding Exposure and Misconfiguration

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers the #1 cause of breaches: **Misconfiguration**. Not "0-day exploits", but simple human error. Default passwords, open buckets, debug modes.

### Fit in the Learning Path
You don't need to be a genius to hack. You just need to find the admin who was lazy.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Default Credentials** (`admin:admin`).
*   **Security by Obscurity** (Why it fails).
*   **Debug Mode** leakage.

## 2. Core Content

### The Low Hanging Fruit
*   **Default Passwords**: Routers, Printers, IoT devices often ship with `admin:password` or `root:toor`.
*   **Unprotected Cloud Buckets**: AWS S3 buckets set to "Public".
*   **Debug/Verbose Errors**: A web app crashing and printing the full Database Structure and Code snippets to the screen.

### Shodan and Defaults
Search engines like Shodan index devices that still have default banners.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Search for Defaults
**Task**: Find the default password for a "Tomcat" server.
1.  Go to `google.com`.
2.  Search: `Tomcat default credentials`.
3.  **Result**: `tomcat:s3cret` or `admin:admin`.

**Task**: Identify Debug Data.
(Conceptual)
If you visit a page `example.com/id=5'` and it returns:
`SQL Syntax Error in line 4: Select * from users where...`
*   This is a **Misconfiguration**. Production servers should NEVER show errors. They should show a generic "Oops" page.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Laziness**: Why do admins leave default passwords? (Because they plan to change it "later", and later never comes).
2.  **Attack Path**: If I find a printer with default creds, how does that help me hack the Domain Controller? (The printer might have the WiFi password saved, or LDAP credentials to the domain).
3.  **Remediation**: What is the fix? (Force password changes on first boot. Disable verbose error reporting in production).

---

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can explain why Default Credentials are a critical risk.
2.  You understand that error messages are "Gold" for attackers.
3.  You stop believing that "hiding" a login page (Obscurity) is security.
