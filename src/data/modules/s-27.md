# Writing Intelligence Briefings

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
The best analysis is useless if no one reads it. Writing for executives (CISO/CEO) is different from writing for engineers (SOC). This module teaches the **BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)** method and how to tailor products for consumers.

### Learning Objectives
*   Write a **BLUF** statement.
*   Structure a report using the **Inverted Pyramid**.
*   Differentiate between Strategic, Operational, and Tactical reports.

## 2. Core Content

### BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)
Executives spend 30 seconds reading your email. Put the conclusion *first*.
*   **Bad:** "On Monday we saw alerts. We investigated IP 1.2.3.4. It looks like... [5 paragraphs later] ... so we need to patch Server X."
*   **Good:** "**BLUF:** Critical Vulnerability in Server X requires immediate patching to prevent RCE. Exploitation detected in the wild."

### The Inverted Pyramid
1.  **Lead:** Most important info (Who, what, when, where, why). Impact?
2.  **Body:** Crucial Context. Evidence. 
3.  **Tail:** Technical details, extra info (methodology).

### Tailoring the Message
*   **Strategic (CEO):** "This threat increases our risk of regulatory fines by 20%. We need $50k to mitigate."
*   **Operational (Manager):** "APT29 is targeting our sector. We need to focus on hunting for 'CozyCar' malware."
*   **Tactical (SOC):** "Block IP 1.2.3.4 and Hash `a1b2...`."

## 3. Lab: The Rewrite

### Task
Rewrite this messy update for a CISO:
> "Hey boss, so I was looking at the firewall logs and I saw this weird traffic coming from Russia. It seems like the Finance Server is talking to a known bad IP. I think it might be beaconing. We should probably take it offline? Not sure if it handles payroll."

**Executive Rewrite:**
> "**BLUF:** Finance Server 1 shows signs of active compromise (C2 beaconing to Russia). 
> **Recommendation:** Authorize immediate isolation of the server to prevent data exfiltration.
> **Impact:** Payroll processing may be delayed 2 hours. 
> **Risk of Inaction:** High probability of financial data theft."

## 4. Reflection
1.  Why avoid jargon like "Heap Spraying" in a Board report? (They don't know what it means. Use "Sophisticated Code Execution" instead).
2.  What is the "So What?" test? (Read every sentence of your report and ask "So what?" If it doesn't matter to the reader, delete it).
