# Cyber Risk Analysis for Executives

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
CEOs don't care about "Cross-Site Scripting". They care about "Loss of Revenue". This module teaches you to translate technical severity (CVSS) into financial risk ($).

### Learning Objectives
*   Differentiate **Technical Risk** vs **Business Risk**.
*   Introduction to **FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk)**.
*   Calculate **ALE (Annualized Loss Expectancy)**.

## 2. Core Content

### The Language Barrier
*   **Analyst:** "We have a SQL Injection."
*   **CEO:** "So what?"
*   **Analyst (Translated):** "We have a vulnerability that would allow a competitor to download our entire customer list, causing a $5M regulatory fine and 10% stock drop."

### The Formula (Simplified)
**Risk = Probability x Impact**
*   **Probability:** How likely is it? (Exploit exists? Actor is targeting us?)
*   **Impact:** What does it cost? (Downtime cost per hour + Fines + Reputation).

### FAIR Model (Conceptual)
A standard logic for quantifying risk.
*   **Threat Event Frequency:** How often are we attacked?
*   **Vulnerability:** How often do they succeed?
*   **Loss Magnitude:** How much does it cost?

## 3. Lab: The "Critical" Patch
**Scenario:** A Critical Vuln (CVSS 10) in a graphics driver.
**Context:** The server is air-gapped in a basement.
**Risk Analysis:**
*   **Technical Severity:** Critical (10/10).
*   **Probability:** Near Zero (No access).
*   **Business Risk:** Low.
*   **Decision:** Patch next month. Do not wake up the team.

## 4. Completion Criteria
1.  **Calculate** ALE if an incident costs $10k and happens 5 times a year ($50k).
2.  **Explain** why CVSS score != Risk.
