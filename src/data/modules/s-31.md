# MISP: The Malware Information Sharing Platform

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
MISP is the de facto standard open-source TIP (Threat Intelligence Platform). It allows organizations to store, share, and correlate IoCs. If you work in CTI, you will use MISP.

### Learning Objectives
*   Understand the MISP data model (Events, Attributes, Objects).
*   Create an **Event** and add **Attributes**.
*   Use **Feeds** to ingest external data.
*   Understand the **Galaxy** (Threat Actors, Tools).

## 2. Core Content

### The Data Model
1.  **Event:** The container. (e.g., "Emotet Campaign 2024").
2.  **Attribute:** A single data point inside an event. (e.g., `ip-dst: 1.2.3.4`, `md5: a1b2...`).
3.  **Object:** A complex structure. (e.g., "File" object containing filename, size, and hash linked together).
4.  **Tag:** Metadata (e.g., `tlp:amber`, `misp-galaxy:tool="CobaltStrike"`).

### Correlation
The magic of MISP. If you add an IP `1.2.3.4` to Event A, and Event B (from 2 years ago) also has `1.2.3.4`, MISP automatically links them. This reveals hidden connections between campaigns.

### Sharing Groups
You don't share everything with everyone.
*   **Community:** Share with connected peers.
*   **Organization:** Internal only.
*   **Distribution Levels:** 0 (Event only), 1 (Community), 2 (Connected Communities), 3 (All).

## 3. Lab: Creating an Event

### Task
You received a phish.

1.  **Create Event:**
    *   Date: Today.
    *   Info: "Internal Phishing Campaign - HR target".
    *   Distribution: This Organization Only.
2.  **Add Attributes:**
    *   `email-src`: `badguy@evil.com`
    *   `url`: `http://login-microsoft-fake.com`
    *   `payload-delivery`: `invoice.pdf`
3.  **Publish:** Click "Publish Event". This makes it available to your API (and downstream tools like SIEM).

## 4. Reflection
1.  Why is "Context" important in MISP? (An IP alone is useless. Tagging it with "C2 Server" and "Active" tells the SOC what to do).
2.  What is a "Warninglist"? (A list of good indicators—like Google DNS 8.8.8.8—that MISP should warn you about if you try to add them as IoCs to prevent false positives).
