# Cookies, Sessions, and Authentication

## Introduction

Since HTTP is stateless (forgetful), how does the website know you are still logged in when you click "Next Page"?

## The Magic of Cookies

A **Cookie** is a small text file the server gives your browser.
1.  **Server**: "Here is a cookie: `SessionID=ABC123XYZ`."
2.  **Browser**: Saves it.
3.  **Browser**: Every time I visit this site again, I will secretly show this cookie.
4.  **Server**: "Oh, I see `SessionID=ABC123XYZ`. I know who you are. You are Alice."

## Sessions vs Tokens

*   **Session**: The ID is just a random string. The server keeps a list in its memory: "`ABC123XYZ` = Alice".
*   **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: The ID itself contains the data. "`User:Alice,Role:Admin`" (Encrypted/Signed). The server doesn't need to remember anything, it just reads the badge.

## Security Risky

If an attacker steals your cookie (`SessionID`), they **become you**. They don't need your username or password. This is called **Session Hijacking**.

## Authentication Factors

To log in initially, we use factors:
1.  **Something you know**: Password.
2.  **Something you have**: Phone (2FA SMS), Hardware Key (YubiKey).
3.  **Something you are**: Fingerprint, FaceID.

> **MFA (Multi-Factor Auth)**: Using more than one of these. Password + SMS is MFA. Password + PIN is NOT (both are "Something you know").

## Why This Matters

Web hacking is often about stealing cookies (XSS) or tricking the server into accepting a fake cookie (Session Forgery).
