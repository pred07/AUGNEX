# OSINT Tooling (Maltego, SpiderFoot)

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
Manual OSINT is slow. Tools automate the collection and visualization of data. We focus on **Maltego** (Link Analysis) and **SpiderFoot** (Automated Scanning).

### Learning Objectives
*   Use **Maltego** to visualize relationships.
*   Run **SpiderFoot** scans for broad enumeration.
*   Understand the limitations of automation (False Positives).

---

## 2. Core Content

### 1. Maltego (The Graph)
*   **Concept:** Entities (Person, Domain, Email) and Transforms (scripts that connect them).
*   **Workflow:** Drag in a Domain -> Run "To DNS Name" -> Run "To IP Address" -> Run "To Location".
*   **Power:** Seeing the *link* between two seemingly unrelated domains (e.g., they share the same Google Analytics ID).

### 2. SpiderFoot (The Scanner)
*   **Concept:** Input a target, select modules (checking 100+ sources), get a report.
*   **Modules:** AbuseIPDB, HaveIBeenPwned, SHODAN, various Blacklists.
*   **Use Case:** Baseline assessments. "What does the internet say about my domain?"

### 3. Command Line Tools (Helpers)
*   **theHarvester:** Rapid email/subdomain scraping.
*   **Sherlock:** Search a username across 300+ social sites.
*   **Hunchly:** Captures everything you see in your browser (Evidence bag). Mandatory for legal cases to prove "I saw this on this date."

## 3. Lab: Visualizing Infrastructure
*Scenario:* You have 3 IP addresses and want to see if they are related.
1.  **Import:** IPs into Maltego.
2.  **Transform:** "To Netblock". result: 2 are in the same block.
3.  **Transform:** "To DNS Name". result: Both resolve to `mail.target.com`.
4.  **Graph:** You see a visual cluster.

## 4. Completion Criteria
1.  **Explain** what a Maltego "Transform" does.
2.  **Identify** why Hunchly is used (Preservation of evidence).
