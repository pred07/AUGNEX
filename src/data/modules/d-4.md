# Security Monitoring Concepts

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module explains *how* we watch. We define **Signatures** vs **Heuristics** (Behavior).

### Fit in the Learning Path
How does an antivirus know a file is bad? How does a firewall know a packet is malicious? You need to know the mechanism to tune it.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Signature-Based Detection** (Hash matching).
*   **Behavior-Based Detection** (Heuristics).
*   **Anomaly Detection** (Baselining).

## 2. Core Content

### 1. Signature-Based (The Old Way)
"If file hash == `bad_hash`, delete it."
*   **Pro**: Fast, low false positives.
*   **Con**: Change 1 byte of the malware, and the hash changes. The "Bad" becomes "Unknown".

### 2. Behavior-Based (The New Way)
"If program opens `cmd.exe` and tries to connect to `Russia`, kill it."
*   **Pro**: Catches Zero-days and modified malware.
*   **Con**: Higher false positives (What if the Admin opens `cmd.exe` to check `ping Russia`?).

### 3. Anomaly Detection
"Bob usually logs in at 9am from NY. Today he logged in at 3am from China."
*   **Pro**: Great for compromised credentials.
*   **Con**: Needs a learning period (Baseline).

## 3. Guided Practice

### Analyzing an Alert
**Alert**: "Suspicious Process: Word.exe spawned Powershell.exe".

**Analysis**:
1.  **Is this a Signature?** No. `Word.exe` is a valid file. `Powershell.exe` is a valid file.
2.  **Is this Behavior?** Yes. Microsoft Word should *never* launch PowerShell. This is classic Macro Malware behavior.

**Action**: Kill the process tree immediately.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Evasion**: How do attackers beat Signatures? (Obfuscation, Recompiling, Packers).
2.  **Evasion**: How do attackers beat Behavior? ("Living off the Land". Using valid tools like `net.exe` in a valid way to create users).
3.  **Tuning**: Why is "Alert on `net user`" a bad rule? (Because Sysadmins use `net user` every day. It creates too much noise).

---

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can explain why Signatures are dying.
2.  You understand the value of Context (Parent-Child process relationships).
3.  You verify that Behavior Analysis is the only way to catch advanced threats.
