# Security Monitoring Concepts

## 1. Unit Brief: Watching the Wires
Monitoring is the process of collecting data to find evil ("badness"). But what do you collect? And how do you know it's evil?

## 2. Real-World Relevance
The attacker effectively controls your network if you don't monitor it. They are the admin now. Monitoring gives you back control.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Data Sources
*   **Logs**: Records of events (Event Viewer, Syslog).
*   **Flows**: Who talked to whom? (NetFlow). "IP A sent 5GB to IP B".
*   **Packets**: Full recording of the conversation (PCAP). "IP A said 'password=123'".

### Signatures vs. Behavior
*   **Signature**: Looking for a known bad hash `bad_virus.exe`.
    *   *Pro*: Low false positives.
    *   *Con*: Easy to bypass (change 1 byte).
*   **Behavior (Heuristics)**: Looking for weird actions. "Word.exe shouldn't be spawning PowerShell.exe".
    *   *Pro*: Catches unknown (Zero-day) threats.
    *   *Con*: High false positives.

## 4. Practical Examples

### The Spike
You monitor outbound traffic volume.
*   **Baseline**: Servers usually send 100MB/day.
*   **Alert**: Server X sent 50GB to Ukraine today.
*   **Conclusion**: Data Exfiltration.

### The Impossible Travel
You monitor User Logins.
*   **Event 1**: Employee logs in from New York at 9:00 AM.
*   **Event 2**: Employee logs in from Moscow at 9:15 AM.
*   **Logic**: Humans cannot travel that fast.
*   **Conclusion**: Compromised Credentials.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Collect Everything**: "Log all packets!" -> Storage fills up in 1 hour. Bill is $1M.
*   **Collect Nothing**: "We don't need logs." -> Incident happens -> Responders are blind.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Use Case Driven**: Decide *what* you want to catch (e.g., Brute Force) and then collect the logs needed to catch it (Auth Logs). Don't just collect random data.
