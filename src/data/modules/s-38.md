## 2. Core Content

### The Watcher
When you scan an attacker's infrastructure, they see you.
*   **Blue Force Tracking:** Attackers monitor their logs. If they see "Nmap Scan from IP X", they block IP X and move infrastructure.
*   **Burned Infrastructure:** Once you touch it, consider it burned.

### Traffic Analysis
*   If you visit a phishing site at 9:00 AM every day requires a script?
*   Attackers fingerprint *Security Vendors*. (e.g., "This IP range belongs to FireEye").

### Managed Attribution
*   **Non-Attributable:** Look like a residential user (Comcast/Verizon IP), not a Cloud Server (AWS/Azure).
*   **Persona:** Don't use a User-Agent that says "Python-Requests". Use "Chrome 120".

## 4. Completion Criteria
1.  **Explain** why scanning from AWS reveals you are a researcher.
2.  **Define** "Burned Infrastructure".
