# Threat Feed Management

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
More data != Better Intelligence. Ingesting 50 feeds usually leads to duplicate alerts and false positives. This module covers **Feed Evaluation**, **Weighting**, and **Aging**.

### Learning Objectives
*   Calculate **Overlap** between feeds.
*   Implement **Time-To-Live (TTL)** for indicators.
*   Differentiate between **Commercial** vs **Open Source** feed value.

## 2. Core Content

### The Noise Problem
*   Feed A says `1.2.3.4` is Malicious.
*   Feed B says `1.2.3.4` is Malicious.
*   Feed C says `1.2.3.4` is Safe.
*   *Result:* Confusion.

### Feed Scoring
Assign a confidence score to each source.
*   **Premium Vendor:** Score 90.
*   **Emerging Threats (Open):** Score 60.
*   **Pastebin Scraper:** Score 20.
*   *Algorithm:* If Score > 80, Block. If Score > 50, Alert.

### Aging (TTL)
Malware infrastructure churns fast.
*   **Phishing URLs:** Valid for ~4 hours.
*   **Malware C2 IPs:** Valid for ~1-3 days.
*   **Scanners:** Valid for weeks.
*   *Rule:* Never block an IP forever. Remove lists older than 7 days automatically.

## 3. Lab: The Feed Audit

### Scenario
Your SIEM is slow. You audit the threat feeds.

1.  **Check Volume:** Feed X sends 1 million IPs a day.
2.  **Check Relevance:** Feed X focuses on "SSH Brute Force in China". Your company is a US Retailer with no SSH exposure.
3.  **Action:** Disable Feed X.

**Outcome:** SIEM performance improves, False Positives drop.

## 4. Reflection
1.  Why are "False Positives" worse than "False Negatives" in automated blocking? (A False Positive breaks business processes—e.g., blocking the CEO's wifi. This gets the security team fired/ignored).
2.  What is the value of "Unique" indicators? (If Feed A has 90% overlap with Feed B, you are paying for the same data twice).
