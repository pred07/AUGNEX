# Types of Intelligence

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
Intelligence is not "One Size Fits All." A Firewall needs an IP address. A Board Member needs a Risk Assessment. We categorize intelligence into **Tactical**, **Operational**, and **Strategic** levels to ensure we speak the right language to the right audience.

### Fit in the Learning Path
You know the Lifecycle (S-2). Now you must format your output. Sending a hash to a CEO will get you fired. Sending a geopolitical essay to a Firewall will break the network.

### Learning Objectives
*   Differentiate the 3 levels: **Tactical, Operational, Strategic**.
*   Map specific deliverables to each level.
*   Understand the "Shelf Life" of each type.

## 2. Core Content

### 1. Tactical Intelligence (The "Now")
*   **Audience:** Machines (SIEM, Firewalls), SOC Analysts.
*   **Content:** Indicators (IPs, Domains, Hashes), Signatures (YARA, Snort).
*   **Goal:** Detection and Blocking.
*   **Lifespan:** Very Short (Minutes to Days).
*   **Example:** "Block IP 1.2.3.4."

### 2. Operational Intelligence (The "How" & "Who")
*   **Audience:** Incident Responders, Threat Hunters, Security Managers.
*   **Content:** TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures), Actor Profiles, Campaign Tracking.
*   **Goal:** Context, Hunting, and Remediation.
*   **Lifespan:** Medium (Weeks to Months).
*   **Example:** "Activity Group 'DeepPanda' is using a specific PowerShell argument. Hunt for it in the logs."

### 3. Strategic Intelligence (The "Why")
*   **Audience:** CISO, Board of Directors, CFO.
*   **Content:** Trends, Financial Impact, Geopolitical drivers, Industry Risk.
*   **Goal:** Budgeting, Policy, and Long-term Strategy.
*   **Lifespan:** Long (Months to Years).
*   **Example:** "Ransomware groups are shifting focus to Healthcare. We need to increase our Cyber Insurance coverage and invest in immutable backups for Q3."

## 3. Lab: The Translation Layer

### Scenario
New Intel: "APT29 is using CVE-2023-1234 to target Diplomatic entities."

### Task: Tri-Level Production
1.  **Tactical Output:**
    *   "SysAdmin: Patch CVE-2023-1234 immediately. SOC: Alert on traffic to `evil-diplomat.com`."
2.  **Operational Output:**
    *   "Threat Hunters: Search historical logs for User-Agent strings associated with 'Nobelium'. APT29 typically persists via ADFS modifications."
3.  **Strategic Output:**
    *   "CISO: State-sponsored espionage activity is increasing in our sector. Current controls are sufficient per the latest Penetration Test, but we should accelerate the Zero Trust Identity project."

## 4. Critical Nuance
*   **Technical != Tactical:** You can have a technical report (Analzying a malware binary) that serves a Strategic purpose (Proving we are targeted by a Nation State).
*   **The "So What?" Test:** Apply it rigorously at every level.

## 5. Completion Criteria
1.  **Classify** a list of 10 intelligence items into Tac/Op/Strat.
2.  **Explain** why you don't send IOCs to the CISO.
3.  **Define** the audience for TTP analysis (Operational).
