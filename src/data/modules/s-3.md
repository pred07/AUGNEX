# Types of Intelligence (Tactical, Operational, Strategic)

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
Intelligence is not one-size-fits-all. A SOC Analyst needs different data than a CISO. This module breaks down the three tiers of Threat Intelligence: **Tactical**, **Operational**, and **Strategic**. You will learn how to produce the right product for the right audience.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will:
*   Classify intelligence products into the three categories
*   Map consumers (SOC vs Incident Response vs Executives) to intelligence types
*   Understand the "Shelf Life" of different intelligence types

## 2. Core Content

### The Triangle of Intelligence

#### 1. Tactical Intelligence (TTPs)
*   **Audience:** The SOC Analyst, The Firewall, The SIEM.
*   **Question:** "What should I block right now?"
*   **Content:** IP addresses, Domains, Hashes (IOCs).
*   **Lifespan:** Very Short (Hours/Days). IPs change constantly.
*   **Automation:** Highly automated (Feeds into SIEM).

#### 2. Operational Intelligence (Context)
*   **Audience:** Incident Responders, Threat Hunters, Security Engineers.
*   **Question:** "How does this attack work?"
*   **Content:** Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures (TTPs). "They use PowerShell encoded commands via scheduled tasks."
*   **Lifespan:** Medium (Months/Years). TTPs are harder to change than IPs.

#### 3. Strategic Intelligence (The Why / The Trend)
*   **Audience:** CISO, Board of Directors, Policy Makers.
*   **Question:** "Who is targeting us and why?"
*   **Content:** Geopolitical trends, Industry Targeting, Risk profiles. "Ransomware groups are targeting healthcare due to legacy infrastructure."
*   **Lifespan:** Long (Years). Motives persist.

### The "pyramid of Pain" Mapping
*   **Tactical:** Hash Values, IP Addresses, Domain Names (Current, easy to change).
*   **Operational:** Network/Host Artifacts, Tools, TTPs (Harder to change).
*   **Strategic:** Tough! (Ideally maps to the Adversary themselves).

## 3. Guided Lab: Intelligence Triage

### Scenario
You receive 3 reports. Classify them and route them to the correct team.

**Report A:** "APT-29 is increasingly targeting cloud supply chains to bypass MFA."
*   **Class:** Strategic / Operational.
*   **Route To:** CISO (budget for YubiKeys), Architects.

**Report B:** "IP 192.168.1.55 is hosting a Cobalt Strike beacon."
*   **Class:** Tactical.
*   **Route To:** SOC (Block in Firewall), IR (Sweep logs).

**Report C:** "The new variant of Emotet uses a specific macro VBA obfuscation technique."
*   **Class:** Operational.
*   **Route To:** Detection Engineers (Write YARA/Sigma rule).

## 4. Reflection Check
1.  Why is giving a Board Member a list of IP addresses a failure of intelligence?
2.  Which type of intelligence requires the most human analysis? (Strategic).
3.  Which type is easiest to automate? (Tactical).

---

## 5. Completion Criteria
1.  **Define** the 3 types.
2.  **Create** a mock report for each type based on a single incident (e.g., a Phishing campaign).
