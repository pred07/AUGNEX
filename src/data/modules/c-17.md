# Signal vs Noise

## 1. What this module covers
Managing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in a SOC. Tuning out the background hum so you can hear the glass break.

## 2. Why this matters for purple teams
A perfect detection buried in 10,000 false positives is effectively a failure.

## 3. Core concepts explained clearly

### Definition
*   **Signal**: The malicious activity.
*   **Noise**: Benign activity that looks like malicious activity. (Admins using PowerShell, Scanners, Updates).

### Tuning Strategies
*   **Filtering**: "exclude User=BackupService".
*   **Throttling**: "Alert once per hour, not once per second".
*   **Aggregation**: "Group by Source IP".

## 4. Validation examples

### Tuning a PowerShell Rule
*   **Rule**: `powershell -enc` (Encoded command).
*   **Noise**: A legitimate backup software agent uses encoded commands every 5 minutes. (1000 alerts/day).
*   **Action**: Analyze the backup script. It is signed by "Vendor X".
*   **Tuning**: `powershell -enc AND Signature != "Vendor X"`.
*   **Result**: Alerts drop to 0. Real attacks (unsigned) will still fire.

## 5. Common gaps and failures
*   **Global Whitelisting**: "Admins used PsExec, so whitelist PsExec globally." -> Attacker uses PsExec and is now whitelisted.
    *   *Fix*: Whitelist "Admins using PsExec from Admin_VLAN", not everywhere.

## 6. Key takeaways
*   **Maintenance**: Environments change. New software creates new noise. Tuning is continuous.
*   **Context**: One man's noise is another man's incident.
