# Signal vs Noise

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers **Data Science** basics for SOC. Finding the needle.

### Fit in the Learning Path
We ingest Terabytes. We want Kilobytes of Alerts. The filter is everything.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Baseline Noise**.
*   **The Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**.
*   **Filtering at Source** vs **Filtering at Query**.

## 2. Core Content

### Analyzing Noise
*   **Sources**: Admin scripts, Vulnerability Scanners, Backup jobs.
*   **Impact**: If SNR is low, analysts ignore the console. (Normalization of Deviance).

### Strategies
1.  **Whitelisting**: "Ignore Scanner IP range". (Risk: Smart attacker pivots from Scanner IP).
2.  **Aggregation**: "Trigger only if > 50 events in 1 minute".
3.  **Enrichment**: Increase Signal by adding context (GeoIP, User Dept).

## 3. Guided Practice

### Tuning the Noise
**Alert**: "Port Scan Detected".
**Volume**: 5,000 / day.
**Investigation**: 4,999 are from `192.168.1.5` (The Qualys Scanner).

**Action**:
Modify Rule: `SrcIP != 192.168.1.5`.
**New Volume**: 1 / day.
**Signal**: Very High. If it fires now, it's a real rogue device.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Blind Spots**: Does filtering create blind spots? (Yes. If you filter the Scanner IP, you better secure the Scanner IP).
2.  **Cost**: Filtering also saves money (Storage costs).
3.  **Review**: Whitelists must be reviewed. If the Scanner IP changes, your rule breaks.

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You despise **Noise**.
2.  You treat **Whitelisting** as a risk management decision.
3.  You aim for high **SNR** (Signal-to-Noise Ratio).
