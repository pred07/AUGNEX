# False Positives and False Negatives

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers the **Errors**. Type I (FP) and Type II (FN).

### Fit in the Learning Path
You will never be perfect. You must choose which error you prefer.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Alert Fatigue** (The cost of FP).
*   **Breach** (The cost of FN).
*   **The Tuning Knob**.

## 2. Core Content

### The Trade-off
*   **Loose Filter**: Catch everything + lots of noise. (High FP, Low FN).
    *   *Risk*: Analyst ignores alerts.
*   **Tight Filter**: Catch only sure things + miss subtle attacks. (Low FP, High FN).
    *   *Risk*: You get hacked and don't know it.

### Calculating Accuracy
`Accuracy = (TP + TN) / Total`.
*   Note: In security, **FN is catastrophic**. We usually tolerate higher FP to avoid FN.

## 3. Guided Practice

### The "Sudo" Alert
**Rule**: Alert on every `sudo` usage.
*   **FP**: Sysadmins use sudo 100 times a day to fix things.
*   **Result**: 100 FPs / Day. Analyst disables rule.
*   **Attack**: Hacker uses sudo. **FN**. (Missed because rule was disabled).

**Better Rule**: Alert on `sudo` usage by `Non-Admin` users.
*   **Result**: 0 FPs. 1 TP (if hacker exploits user).

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Testing**: How do you measure FN? (Red Teaming. You simulate an attack and see if it was missed).
2.  **Feedback**: Analysts must tell Engineers "This rule sucked" (FP) or "Good catch" (TP).
3.  **Philosophy**: "It is better to review 10 false alarms than to miss 1 fire." (Within reason).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can define **Type I** and **Type II** errors.
2.  You understand that **tuning is a never-ending process**.
3.  You accept that **Zero FPs is impossible**.
