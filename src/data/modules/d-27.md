# Malware Fundamentals

## 1. Unit Brief: Understanding the Payload
Malware is software written with malicious intent. It is a tool, not a magic spell. It is code that runs on a CPU.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **WannaCry**: Ransomware worm.
*   **Stuxnet**: Cyber-warfare tool targeting centrifuges.
*   **Emotet**: Banking Trojan turned Malware Loader.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Types
*   **Virus**: Replicates by attaching to files.
*   **Worm**: Replicates via network.
*   **Trojan**: Pretends to be good, is actually bad.
*   **Ransomware**: Encrypts files for money.
*   **Rootkit**: Hides presence (Kernel level).
*   **Keylogger**: Records keystrokes.

### Analysis
*   **Static**: Reading the code without running it (Strings, Disassembly).
*   **Dynamic**: Running it in a sandbox (Cuckoo) and watching what it does.

## 4. Practical Examples

### Strings Analysis
Running `strings malware.exe` often reveals:
*   IP addresses (C2).
*   File paths (`C:\Windows\Temp\payload.dll`).
*   Typos made by the author.

### Hash Lookup
You find a suspicious file. Get the SHA256 hash.
Search it on VirusTotal.
*   **Result**: 55/60 engines say "Emotet".
*   **Action**: Delete it.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Opening Malware**: "I wanted to see what the invoice PDF looked like." -> You are infected. Always analyze in an isolated VM.
*   **Assuming PDF is safe**: PDF can contain JavaScript.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Handling**: Treat malware like a biohazard.
*   **Goal**: The goal of analysis is "IOCs" (Indicators of Compromise) - IPs, Hashes, Domains to block.
