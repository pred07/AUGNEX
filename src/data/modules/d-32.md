# Insider Threat Basics

## 1. Unit Brief: The Enemy Within
An Insider Threat is someone with authorized access who harms the organization. They are the hardest to detect because they don't need to "break in". They have a key.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Malicious**: A sales rep downloading the customer database before quitting to join a competitor.
*   **Negligent**: An admin accidentally pasting API keys to public GitHub.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Indicators
*   **HR Triggers**: Resignation letter submitted, Bad performance review, Layoffs.
*   **Technical Triggers**: High volume printing, Large USB transfers, Accessing files at 3 AM.

### Privileged Access Management (PAM)
Monitoring what admins do.
*   "Jump Boxes": Admins must login to a recorded session to access servers.
*   "Just-in-Time": Admin rights granted for 1 hour, then revoked.

## 4. Practical Examples

### The Exfiltration
*   **Alert**: "User Bob uploaded 5GB to Google Drive."
*   **Context**: Bob put in his 2 weeks notice yesterday.
*   **Action**: Revoke access immediately. Legal hold on laptop.

### The Logic Bomb
*   **Scenario**: Developer writes code that deletes the database if his name disappears from the payroll system.
*   **Defense**: Code Review. No single person should be able to push code to production without approval.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Blind Trust**: "I've known Dave for 10 years, he wouldn't do that." (Money problems change people).
*   **Ignoring Negligence**: The well-meaning idiot causes more damage than the malicious spy. Training is the fix.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Zero Trust**: Trust but Verify.
*   **DLP (Data Loss Prevention)**: Tools that stop sensitive data (Credit Cards, Code) from leaving the network.
