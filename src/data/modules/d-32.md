# Disk Forensics and Artifacts

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers reading the dead drive. **NTFS**, **MFT**, and **Deleted Files**.

### Fit in the Learning Path
Users delete files. Hackers delete tools. The disk remembers.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **MFT** (Master File Table).
*   **Prefetch**.
*   **Slack Space**.

## 2. Core Content

### NTFS Artifacts (Windows)
1.  **MFT**: Database of every file. Even deleted ones are just marked "Overwrite-able", the data remains until overwritten.
2.  **Prefetch (`.pf`)**: Windows tracks apps to launch them faster.
    *   *Forensic Value*: Proof an app ran. "Badguy.exe ran on Jan 1st at 10:00".
3.  **Registry Hives**: `SAM`, `SYSTEM`, `SOFTWARE`.

### Slack Space
A file of 1kb takes up a 4kb cluster. The remaining 3kb is "Slack". Hackers sometimes hide data there.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Carving (Autopsy)
**Action**: Recover deleted photos.
**Tool**: Autopsy / PhotoRec.
**Logic**: Look for file headers. A JPEG always starts with `FF D8`.
*   The tool scans the raw bytes. If it sees `FF D8`, it grabs the data until it sees the footer `FF D9`.
*   *Result*: Deleted file recovered.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **SSD**: Does TRIM kill forensics? (Yes. On modern SSDs, deleted data is actively wiped by the controller to maintain speed. Recovery is much harder).
2.  **Timestomping**: Can hackers fake timestamps? (Yes. But the MFT has two sets of timestamps: Standard Info (Fakeable) and FileName (Harder to fake). Inconsistency reveals the lie).
3.  **LNK Files**: Shortcut files. (Value: Proves a user opened a file, or plugged in a USB drive).

---

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can define **MFT**.
2.  You understand that "Empty Trash Pattern" doesn't mean "Gone".
3.  You know the value of **Prefetch** for execution evidence.
