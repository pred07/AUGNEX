# Backup, Recovery, and Resilience

## 1. Unit Brief: The Safety Net
When all defenses fail (and they will), Backups are the only thing standing between business survival and bankruptcy.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Ransomware**: Encrypts your live data AND your connected backups.
*   **Resilience**: The ability to absorb the punch and keep fighting.

## 3. Core Concepts

### The 3-2-1 Rule
*   **3** copies of data.
*   **2** different media types (Disk, Cloud/Tape).
*   **1** offsite (Air-gapped).

### RTO vs RPO
*   **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: "How fast?" (We need to be up in 4 hours).
*   **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: "How much data loss?" (We can lose 15 mins of data).

### Immutable Backups
*   Backups that cannot be modified or deleted, even by the Admin.
*   The content is "Locked" (WORM) for X days.
*   Defeats Ransomware.

## 4. Practical Examples

### Testing Restores
*   Schrödinger's Backup: The condition of any backup is unknown until you try to restore it.
*   **Drill**: Once a quarter, actually restore the Database to a test server. Does it work?

### Air Gapping
*   Disconnecting the hard drive.
*   Using tape (Tape cannot be hacked).

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Backing up corrupted data**: If the malware corrupts the DB, and you back up the corrupted DB, you restore garbage. (Need versioning).
*   **Storing keys with the lock**: Storing the Backup Decryption Key on the same server as the Backup.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Availability**: Is a pillar of CIA. Backups ensure Availability.
*   **Offline is King**: If it's online, it can be hacked.
