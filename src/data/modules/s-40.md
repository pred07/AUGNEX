# CTI Capstone: The Full Cycle

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This is the final module of the Sentinel Path. We synthesize everything: Planning, Collection, Processing, Analysis, Dissemination, and Tools. You will walk through a complete lifecycle simulation.

### Learning Objectives
*   Execute the full **Intelligence Cycle**.
*   Produce a **Final Intelligence Product**.

## 2. Core Content

### The Scenario
**Intel:** You receive a tip that "APT-X" is targeting your sector with a new ransomware variant "CryptX".

### Phase 1: Planning (s-2)
*   **PIR:** What are the IOCs for CryptX? What is the delivery vector?

### Phase 2: Collection (s-6, s-36)
*   **Method:** Scour Dark Web forums. Check VirusTotal for hash samples.
*   **Result:** Found sample `invoice.exe` (Hash: `abc...`).

### Phase 3: Processing (s-17, s-19)
*   **Analysis:** Run in Cuckoo Sandbox.
*   **Result:** It beacons to `update-cryptx.com`. It uses a specific Registry Key `HKCU\...\CryptX`.

### Phase 4: Analysis (s-23, s-20)
*   **Diamond Model:** Map Infra (`update-cryptx.com`) to Capability (`CryptX`).
*   **Hunt:** Search SIEM for domain. Search endpoints for Registry Key.

### Phase 5: Dissemination (s-27)
*   **Report:** "BLUF: Imminent Ransomware Threat. Block `update-cryptx.com`. Isolate Host A which visited it."
*   **Format:** STIX bundle sent to Firewall. PDF to CISO.

### Phase 6: Feedback
*   **Result:** Attack blocked. 
*   **Lesson:** We need faster sandbox processing.
