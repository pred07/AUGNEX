# Privilege Escalation Methodology

## 1. Unit Brief: Going Up
You gained a foothold. You are `www-data` or `jdoe`. But you want to be `root` or `SYSTEM`. Privilege Escalation (PrivEsc) is the art of abusing misconfigurations or kernel bugs to elevate your access.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
*   **Low User**: Can read their own emails.
*   **Root**: Can read everyone's emails, install software, and wipe the logs.

## 3. Core Concepts

### The Strategy
1.  **Enumerate**: What do I have? (User ID, Groups). What is running? (Services, Cron jobs).
2.  **Match**: Do any of these match known vulnerabilities?
3.  **Exploit**: Run the exploit.

### Vertical vs Horizontal
*   **Horizontal**: `user1` -> `user2` (Stealing a peer's password).
*   **Vertical**: `user1` -> `root` (Becoming God).

## 4. Practical Examples

### Automated Enumeration Scripts
Don't look manually. Run a script.
*   **Linux**: `LinPEAS.sh` (Linux Privilege Escalation Awesome Script).
*   **Windows**: `WinPEAS.exe`.

### The "Sudo" Check
First thing to type on Linux:
```bash
$ sudo -l
User www-data may run the following commands on host:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vim
```
*   **Exploit**: `sudo vim -c ':!/bin/sh'` -> You are root.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Running Kernel Exploits First**: Kernel exploits (DirtyCow) are risky. They crash the server. Always look for misconfigurations (Sudo, Cron, Path) first.
*   **Not checking history**: `cat ~/.bash_history` often contains passwords typed by the user.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Enum is King**: 90% of PrivEsc is finding the hole. 10% is exploiting it.
*   **Scripts**: LinPEAS is your best friend.
