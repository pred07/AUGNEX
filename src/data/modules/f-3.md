# Hypervisors: Type 1 vs Type 2

## Introduction

A **Hypervisor** (or VMM - Virtual Machine Monitor) is the software that creates and runs virtual machines. It sits between the hardware and the virtual machines. There are two main types you must know.

## Type 1: Bare Metal (Native)

This hypervisor installs directly on the hardware, replacing the Operating System.

*   **Where it lives**: Directly on the metal (Hardware -> Hypervisor -> VMs).
*   **Examples**: VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V (Server), Xen.
*   **Use Case**: Enterprise servers, cloud providers (AWS, Azure), Data Centers.
*   **Pros**: extremely fast, efficient.

## Type 2: Hosted

This hypervisor runs as an *application* inside your existing Operating System. This is what we will use.

*   **Where it lives**: On top of your OS (Hardware -> OS -> Hypervisor -> VMs).
*   **Examples**: Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Workstation Player.
*   **Use Case**: Personal labs, testing, learning.
*   **Pros**: Easy to install, user-friendly.

## Comparing Them

| Feature | Type 1 (Bare Metal) | Type 2 (Hosted) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Location** | Directly on Hardware | Inside an OS (like Windows 10) |
| **Performance** | High (Near native) | Medium (Overhead of host OS) |
| **Setup** | Complex (Replaces OS) | Simple (Install like an app) |
| **Our Choice** | No | **Yes** |

## Why This Matters

We are building a **Types 2** lab using VirtualBox or VMware Player. We don't need a dedicated server rack; we just need our laptop.

## Next Steps

Get ready. In the next module, we will download and install our practice operating system.
