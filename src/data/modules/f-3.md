# Hypervisors: Type 1 vs Type 2

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
We dive deeper into the engine that powers virtualization: The Hypervisor. We will distinguish between "Bare Metal" (Type 1) and "Hosted" (Type 2) hypervisors.

### Fit in the Learning Path
You need to know which tool to choose. For your home lab, you will use Type 2. For a corporate data center, you will likely encounter Type 1.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   The architectural difference between Type 1 and Type 2.
*   Examples of each (VMware ESXi vs VirtualBox).
*   Why we choose Type 2 for the **FORGE** path.

## 2. Core Content

### The Hypervisor
The Hypervisor is the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM). It allocates RAM/CPU to the VMs.

### Type 1: Bare Metal
*   **Architecture**: The Hypervisor installs *directly* on the hardware. There is no Windows/Linux underneath.
*   **Performance**: Extreme. No overhead from a host OS.
*   **Use Case**: Enterprise Servers, Cloud Providers (AWS, Azure).
*   **Examples**: VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V (Server), Proxmox VE.

### Type 2: Hosted
*   **Architecture**: The Hypervisor runs as an *application* on top of your existing OS (Windows/MacOS/Linux).
*   **Performance**: Good, but slower. The instructions have to pass through the Host OS.
*   **Use Case**: Personal Labs, Developers, Security Testers.
*   **Examples**: Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Workstation Player.

### Why We Use Type 2
For this course, we use **Type 2** (VirtualBox or VMware Player) because:
1.  **Convenience**: You can use your computer for browsing/gaming while the Lab runs in a window.
2.  **Cost**: They are free.
3.  **Simplicity**: Easier to set up networking on a laptop.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Identifying Your Hypervisor Strategy
Since you are likely learning on a laptop or desktop PC, we will adopt a **Type 2** strategy.

**Research Task**:
1.  Go to the [VirtualBox Website](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
2.  Go to the [VMware Workstation Player Website](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html).
3.  **Comparison**: Note that VirtualBox is Open Source, while VMware is proprietary (but free for personal use).

**Decision**:
For the **FORGE** path, we officially recommend **VirtualBox** because it is universally compatible and free.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Security**: Which type allows a larger attack surface? A Type 2 hypervisor running on a patch-less Windows 7 host, or a Type 1 ESXi server?
2.  **Resilience**: If your Windows Host drags to a halt because of a Chrome update, what happens to your Type 2 VM?
3.  **Scenario**: You are hired to build a secure malware analysis lab for a bank. Would you put it on a laptop (Type 2) or a dedicated isolated server (Type 1)?

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can classify "VirtualBox" as a Type 2 Hypervisor.
2.  You understand that Type 1 runs directly on hardware.
3.  You are mentally prepared to install a Type 2 Hypervisor in the next module.
