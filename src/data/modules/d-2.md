# SOC Structure and Responsibilities

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module takes a deep look inside the **Security Operations Center (SOC)**. The room (or Zoom call) where the defense happens.

### Fit in the Learning Path
You cannot defend an enterprise alone. The SOC is the organism that processes the chaos of the network into actionable intelligence.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **The Triage Funnel**.
*   **Shift Work** (24/7 coverage).
*   **Playbooks** (SOPs).

## 2. Core Content

### The Triage Funnel
1.  **Events**: 1 Billion/day. (Raw logs: "User logged in").
2.  **Alerts**: 10,000/day. (Logic matches: "User logged in from North Korea").
3.  **Cases**: 50/day. (Human confirms: "This looks weird").
4.  **Incidents**: 1/day. (Confirmed breach).

### Responsibilities
*   **Monitor**: Eyes on glass.
*   **Analyze**: Contextualize the alert. (Is this normal for Bob?).
*   **Respond**: Isolate the host. Reset the password.

### Playbooks
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). "If Ransomware -> Disconnect Network Cable -> Call CISO."
*   *Why?* Panic kills brain cells. Playbooks replace thinking with execution during crisis.

## 3. Guided Practice

### Alert Analysis Logic
**Alert**: "Failed Login detected for user 'Admin'".
**Count**: 500 times in 1 minute.
**Source IP**: Russia.

**Action Plan (Playbook)**:
1.  **Severity**: High (Brute Force in progress).
2.  **Check**: Was it successful? (Did any 'Success' log follow?).
3.  **Response**: Block IP at Firewall.
4.  **Notify**: Tell the Admin to check their account.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **False Positives**: What happens if you block the CEO's legitimate login? (You get yelled at. Availability vs Security trade-off).
2.  **Automation**: Can AI replace the SOC? (It can replace Tier 1 Triage, but not Tier 3 Contextual Analysis).
3.  **Visibility**: If the SOC can't see the Endpoint (Laptop), can they protect it? (No. Blind spots are fatal).

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You can draw the Triage Funnel.
2.  You understand why Playbooks are mandatory.
3.  You respect the massive volume of data a SOC handles.
