# SOC Structure and Responsibilities

## 1. Unit Brief: The Command Center
The Security Operations Center (SOC) is the heartbeat of modern defense. It centralizes people, processes, and technology to detect/respond to threats 24/7.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
When Ransomware hits at 3 AM on a Sunday, the SOC is the team that receives the pager alert and stops the encryption before Monday morning.

## 3. Core Concepts

### The Tiers
*   **Tier 1 (Triage)**: High volume. "Is this alert junk?" Filter out the noise. Pass real threats to Tier 2.
*   **Tier 2 (Responder)**: Deep dive. "This looks real. Let's analyze the infected host."
*   **Tier 3 (Hunter/Expert)**: "We have a novel APT in the network. Let's reverse engineer their malware."

### The Technology Stack
*   **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**: The brain. Collects logs.
*   **SOAR (Orchestration)**: The hands. Automates actions (e.g., automatically block an IP at the firewall).
*   **Ticketing System**: The memory. Tracks every incident.

## 4. Practical Examples

### The Flow of an Alert
1.  **Firewall** logs a connection to a known C2 server.
2.  **SIEM** sees the log and triggers rule: `C2_Traffic_Detected`.
3.  **Tier 1 Analyst** sees the ticket. Verifies the IP is bad on VirusTotal.
4.  **Tier 1** escalates to **Tier 2**.
5.  **Tier 2** isolates the infected PC from the network using EDR.
6.  **Incident Closed**.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Alert Fatigue**: Configuring the SIEM to alert on *everything*. Result: Analysts ignore everything.
*   **Lack of Playbooks**: Panic ensues when an alert fires because nobody wrote down the steps to follow.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **Structure Matters**: A chaotic SOC misses alerts.
*   **Automation is Key**: Humans cannot process 1 million logs per second. Machines must filter first.
