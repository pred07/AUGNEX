# Intel Ethics, Bias, and Reliability (Admiralty Scale)

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
Intelligence is never 100% certain. It is an estimation based on incomplete data. This module teaches you how to **grade** that data using the NATO standard **Admiralty Scale** (Source Reliability vs. Info Credibility) and how to identify **Cognitive Biases** (Mirror Imaging, Groupthink) that lead to intelligence failures.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will:
*   Apply the **Admiralty Code (A1 to F6)** to every piece of intel you produce.
*   Identify "Circular Reporting" (Source A cites B, B cites A).
*   Recognize "Mirror Imaging" (Assuming the enemy thinks like you).
*   Understand the ethical boundaries of OSINT (Doxing vs Intel).

## 2. Core Content

### The Admiralty Scale (NATO Standard)

#### Source Reliability (Rows)
*   **A - Completely Reliable:** Proven track record, no doubt (e.g., Packet capture, Digitally signed logs).
*   **B - Usually Reliable:** Good record, minor errors (e.g., Trusted Vendor Feed).
*   **C - Fairly Reliable:** Occasional reliability (e.g., Human Source).
*   **D - Not Usually Reliable:** History of falsification.
*   **E - Unreliable:** Known liar/fabricator.
*   **F - Reliability Cannot Be Judged:** New source.

#### Information Credibility (Columns)
*   **1 - Confirmed:** Corroborated by other independent sources.
*   **2 - Probably True:** Consistent with known data.
*   **3 - Possibly True:** Consistent behavior, but unconfirmed.
*   **4 - Doubtful:** Inconsistent with established patterns.
*   **5 - Improbable:** Contradicts known facts.
*   **6 - Cannot Be Judged.**

**Usage:** "This report is graded **B2**." (Trusted source, probably true info).
*   *Trap:* Don't confuse Source with Info. An "A" source can tell you a "5" lie (they were tricked).

### Analytical Biases
The brain takes shortcuts. In Intelligence, shortcuts kill.

1.  **Mirror Imaging:** "I wouldn't attack on a holiday, so they won't."
    *   *Reality:* They attack *specifically* on holidays because you are offline.
2.  **Circular Reporting (Echo Chamber):**
    *   Vendor X says "Attack imminent."
    *   Vendor Y reads X, says "Attack imminent" (citing X).
    *   You read both and think "Two sources confirm it!" (It's actually one source).
3.  **Confirmation Bias:** Looking only for evidence that supports your hypothesis (e.g., "It's Russia") and ignoring evidence that points to China.

## 3. Case Study: The Iraqi WMD Failure (Curveball)

### Analysis
The US Intelligence Community assessment that Iraq had WMDs was a failure of source validation.
*   **Source:** "Curveball" (Iraqi defector).
*   **Grade:** Should have been **E4** (Unreliable source, Doubtful info).
*   **Failure:** Analysts *wanted* to believe it (Confirmation Bias) and ignored warnings from other services (Groupthink).
*   **Result:** Strategic failure.

## 4. Reflection Check
1.  Why is an IP address from a firewall log an "A1"? (It's a machine record, confirmed by existence).
2.  Why is a "Tweet" usually an "F" source?
3.  How do you sanitize data to prevent Doxing innocent third parties during an investigation?

## 5. Completion Criteria
1.  **Grade** a provided sample intelligence tip using A-F / 1-6.
2.  **Identify** one instance of Circular Reporting in recent cyber news.
