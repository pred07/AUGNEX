# Intelligence Ethics, Bias & Reliability

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
Intelligence is subjective. A human analyst interprets data. Humans are flawed. This module covers the **Cognitive Biases** that ruin investigations and the **Ethical Standards** (Admiralty Scale) required to maintain credibility.

### Learning Objectives
*   Identify **Confirmation Bias** and **Anchoring**.
*   Apply the **Admiralty Scale** (A1 to F6) to grade intelligence.
*   Practice **ACH (Analysis of Competing Hypotheses)**.

## 2. Core Content

### The Human Bug: Cognitive Biases
1.  **Confirmation Bias:** Looking for evidence that supports your theory and ignoring evidence that contradicts it.
    *   *Example:* "I think it's Russia, so I'm only looking for Cyrillic strings."
2.  **Anchoring:** Relying too heavily on the first piece of information found.
    *   *Example:* "The alert said 'Emotet', so I'm treating it as Emotet," (even though the alert was a false positive).
3.  **Mirror Imaging:** Assuming the adversary thinks like you.
    *   *Example:* "They won't attack on Christmas." (Attacker is in a different timezone/culture).

### The Solution: ACH (Analysis of Competing Hypotheses)
A scientific method for intel.
1.  List all Hypotheses (H1: It's Russia. H2: It's China. H3: It's a Teenager).
2.  List Evidence.
3.  Matrix: Does evidence support or refute each H?
4.  **Disprove** scenarios. The one closest to impossible to disprove is likely the truth.

### The Standard: The Admiralty Scale
Use this to tag every piece of intel you produce.

**Source Reliability (Letters):**
*   **A** - Completely Reliable (No doubt. History of perfection).
*   **B** - Usually Reliable (Mostly good, minor errors historically).
*   **C** - Fairly Reliable.
*   **D** - Not Usually Reliable.
*   **E** - Unreliable.
*   **F** - Cannot Judge (New source).

**Information Credibility (Numbers):**
*   **1** - Confirmed by other sources.
*   **2** - Probably True.
*   **3** - Possibly True.
*   **4** - Doubtful.
*   **5** - Improbable.
*   **6** - Cannot Judge.

*Example:* "We have a **B3** report that LockBit is targeting us." (Good source, but the claim is unverified).

## 3. Lab: Grading Intelligence

### Scenario
An anonymous user on Twitter claims "Google has been hacked."

### Grading
*   **Source:** Twitter rando. **F** (Cannot Judge / Unknown).
*   **Information:** Google is up. No other reports. **5** (Improbable) or **6** (Cannot Judge).
*   **Rating:** F5 / F6.
*   **Action:** Monitor, but do not wake up the CISO.

## 4. Ethics
*   **Privacy:** Don't doxx innocent victims of a breach.
*   **Attribution:** Don't blame a country unless you are 100% sure. (Geopolitics is dangerous).
*   **Minimize Harm:** Don't experiment on live production systems.
