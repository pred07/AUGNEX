# Final Penetration Test Report Structure

## 1. Unit Brief: The Template
A standard industry report follows a specific structure. Clients expect this format.

## 2. Real-World Relevance
Standardization allows clients to compare reports from different years and different vendors.

## 3. Core Concepts

### The Sections
1.  **Cover Page**: Title, Date, Client Name, Your Name/Company, Classification (Confidential).
2.  **Table of Contents**.
3.  **Executive Summary**: High-level overview, Risk Score, Strategic advice.
4.  **methodology**: What did you do? (PTES, OWASP). What tools?
5.  **Scope**: What was tested? (IPs, URLs). What was EXCLUDED?
6.  **Findings (Technical)**: The meat of the report. One page per finding.
7.  **Appendices**: Raw scan data, lengthy logs.

### Finding Template
*   **Title**
*   **Severity** (Crit/High/Med/Low/Info).
*   **CVSS Score**.
*   **Status** (Open).
*   **Description**.
*   **Evidence** (Screenshots).
*   **Remediation**.
*   **References** (Links toOWASP/CVE).

## 4. Practical Examples

### Scope Section
*   **Included**: `subdomain.target.com`, `192.168.1.5`.
*   **Excluded**: `thirdparty.vendor.com` (Do not touch!).

### Methodology Statement
"We utilized the OSSTMM and PTES frameworks, beginning with passive reconnaissance, moving to active scanning, vulnerability assessment, and manual exploitation."

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make
*   **Typos**: Use Spellcheck. A report with typos looks unprofessional and untrustworthy.
*   **Broken Formatting**: Verify that screenshots fit on the page and code blocks are readable.

## 6. Key Takeaways
*   **The Report IS the Deliverable**: A bad report makes a great hack look bad. A great report makes a mediocre hack look valuable.
