# Building a Security Culture

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
This module covers **Influence**. Making people care.

### Fit in the Learning Path
You can't click the mouse for every employee. They are the perimeter.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should understand:
*   **Security Champions**.
*   **Gamification**.
*   **No-Shame Reporting**.

## 2. Core Content

### The "Stupid User" Fallacy
If a user clicks a link, it's not their fault. It's yours.
*   your email filter failed.
*   your training failed.
*   your endpoint controls failed.

### Positive Reinforcement
*   *Old Way*: Punish users who fail phishing tests. (Result: Fear, silence).
*   *New Way*: Reward users who report phishing emails. (Result: Millions of sensors).

## 3. Guided Practice

### Running a CTF
**Event**: Internal Capture The Flag.
*   **Devs**: Let them hack a broken version of their own app.
*   **Insight**: "Oh, THAT'S what an XSS does? I'll fix it right now."
*   Nothing teaches better than offense.

## 4. Reflection Check

1.  **Tone**: Security newsletters are usually boring. Make them funny. Share stories.
2.  **Visibility**: celebrate wins. "Thanks to Sarah in HR for reporting this weird email, we stopped an attack."
3.  **Leadership**: If the CEO shares his password, the culture is dead. Start at the top.

## 5. Completion Criteria

This module is complete when:
1.  You stop blaming **Users**.
2.  You implement **Positive Reinforcement**.
3.  You run an internal **Security Awareness Event** (like a CTF).
