# Campaign Analysis & Tracking

## 1. Orientation

### What this module covers
A single intrusion is an incident. A series of intrusions by the same actor with the same goal is a **Campaign**. This module covers the methodology of tracking campaigns over time using naming conventions and trend analysis.

### Learning Objectives
*   Define a Campaign based on shared TTPs.
*   Adopt a consistent Naming Convention.
*   Create a Strategic Threat Profile.

## 2. Core Content

### Defining a Campaign
You need a cluster of evidence (Diamond Model). 
*   *Hypothesis:* "All attacks using the 'BlueBanana' malware against banks in July are related."
*   *Validation:* Do they assume the same C2 structure? Do they recycle code?

### Naming Conventions
Everyone names things differently (CrowdStrike: FANCY BEAR, Mandiant: APT28, Microsoft: Strontium). 
*   **Best Practice:** Use internal code names until you can confidently map to a public group. Call it "UNC123" (Uncategorized 123) or "Activity Group A". 
*   *Why?* If you incorrectly call it "APT28", executives will assume it's Russia. If it turns out to be a teenager, you lose credibility.

### Tracking Trends
CTI is not just about today. It's about the delta.
*   "Last year, Group A used Phishing. This year, they are using VPN Vulnerabilities."
*   "Their dwell time decreased from 40 days to 4 days."
*   **This informs investment:** "We need to stop buying Email filters and start patching VPNs."

## 3. Lab: The Merger

### Scenario
You have two internal activity groups:
*   **Group A:** Targets HR. Uses "MacroBackdoor". IPs: 1.1.1.1.
*   **Group B:** Targets Finance. Uses "MacroBackdoor v2". IPs: 1.1.1.2.

**New Evidence:**
Malware analysis shows "MacroBackdoor v2" contains a hardcoded fallback IP of `1.1.1.1`.

**Decision:**
Merge Group A and Group B. This is one campaign evolving its toolset.

## 4. Reflection
1.  Why do vendors use different names for the same actor? (Marketing/Branding. "Pandas" vs "Bears" vs "Kittens" creates brand recognition).
2.  What is the risk of merging groups too early? (You might blend two distinct actors into one profile, confusing your analysis of their motives).
