# Reducing Alert Fatigue

## 1. What this module covers
The psychology of "Cry Wolf". How to keep analysts engaged.

## 2. Why this matters for purple teams
If the Blue Team ignores the dashboard because "It's always red", the Red Team is invisible.

## 3. Core concepts explained clearly

### Severity Inflation
*   If everything is "Critical", nothing is "Critical".
*   **High**: Immediate breach execution.
*   **Medium**: Suspicious behavior.
*   **Low**: Information/Policy violation (P2P software).
*   **Info**: Just logging.

### The "Snooze" Button
*   Allow analysts to suppress known bad alerts for a set time (e.g., "Scanning is approved for 2 hours"). Prevent repeated firing.

## 4. Validation examples

### The Fatigue Test
*   **Action**: Analyze the Top 10 High Volume Alerts.
*   **Scenario**: Alert #1 fires 1000 times/day. It is "User Account Locked".
*   **Question**: Do we investigate all 1000? No. So why is it an "Alert"?
*   **Fix**: Downgrade to "Report". Review the report once a day.

## 5. Common gaps and failures
*   **Default Vendor Rules**: Turning on "All Rules" from the vendor. This is suicide for a SOC. You get 5000 alerts instantly.
*   **Zombie Rules**: Rules created 5 years ago for a threat that no longer exists.

## 6. Key takeaways
*   **Respect the queue**: If an alert enters the queue, it MUST require action. If no action is needed, it shouldn't be an alert.
