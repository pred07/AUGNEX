Phase 1 — Audit (DO NOT suggest changes yet)

Audit the website across both mobile and laptop viewports.

1. UI & Visual Design

Color palette consistency (brand alignment, contrast, accessibility)

Typography (font choice, hierarchy, readability)

Spacing, alignment, layout balance

Light/Dark mode behavior (if present)

Visual noise vs clarity

2. UX & Interaction

Button placement, size, and affordance

Primary vs secondary CTAs clarity

Navigation flow (can a first-time user understand where to go?)

Hover, focus, active, disabled states

Feedback on actions (loading, success, error)

3. Mobile Responsiveness

Touch target sizes

Thumb-zone usability

Scroll behavior

Content prioritization on small screens

Navbar / menu behavior

4. Icons & Micro-UI

Icon meaning clarity

Consistency of icon style

Whether text + icon combinations are needed

Redundant or confusing icons

5. Functional Audit

Check if all buttons, links, forms, and flows actually work

Identify:

Dead clicks

Broken links

Confusing flows

Redundant actions

Authentication flows (login / signup clarity)

6. Performance & Perceived Speed

Initial load experience

Layout shifts

Over-animation or under-feedback

Perceived responsiveness on low-end devices

7. Commercial Readiness

Does it feel trustworthy?

Does it feel polished or “side project”?

Would a real user trust this with their account/data?

Is the value proposition immediately clear?

Assume everything should already work unless proven otherwise

Be critical, honest, and specific

Avoid vague advice like “improve UX”

Think like a product reviewer + growth designer
