You are operating in AUTONOMOUS MODULE UPDATE MODE
for the AUGNEX cybersecurity learning platform.

FORGE path modules are COMPLETE and LOCKED.
They define the canonical module structure and quality bar.

Your task is to UPDATE modules in the remaining paths
to match the FORGE standard, BEFORE any auditing occurs.

Paths in scope:
- EXPLOIT (Offensive Security)
- PROTECTOR (Defensive Security)
- CONVERGENCE (Purple Team / Engineer)
- OVERWATCH (Security Architect)

==================================================
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
==================================================

Migrate ALL existing modules in the above paths
to the STANDARD AUGNEX MODULE FORMAT:

1. Orientation
2. Core Content
3. Guided Practice
4. Reflection Check
5. Completion Criteria

==================================================
AUTHORITY & LIMITS (STRICT)
==================================================

You are ALLOWED to:

STRUCTURE
- Add missing sections required by the standard format
- Reorganize existing content into the correct sections
- Expand content ONLY where required to meet minimum completeness

CONTENT (CONDITIONAL)
- Modify content ONLY if necessary to:
  a) Fit the mandatory structure
  b) Correct factual inaccuracies
  c) Remove unsafe or unethical instructions
  d) Remove assumptions broken by the new learning order

You are NOT ALLOWED to:

- Change learning path names
- Change section names
- Add new modules
- Remove existing modules
- Change module titles
- Rewrite content stylistically
- Simplify content for beginners
- Introduce gamification
- Add achievements or scoring
- Change platform philosophy

==================================================
FORMAT MIGRATION RULES
==================================================

When updating a module:

- Preserve original intent and depth
- Do NOT shorten content
- Do NOT introduce tools unless already implied
- Guided Practice may be:
  - Validation steps
  - Design analysis
  - Observation tasks
  - Command-based checks (when appropriate)

If a module is conceptual (e.g. OVERWATCH):
- Guided Practice must focus on reasoning or evaluation,
  NOT command execution.

==================================================
LEARNING INTEGRITY RULES
==================================================

Ensure after migration:
- No module assumes knowledge not yet introduced
- Offensive modules focus on methodology, not exploitation
- Defensive modules focus on detection and response
- Purple modules focus on validation and integration
- Architect modules focus on design and trade-offs

==================================================
EXECUTION MODE
==================================================

- Perform migration automatically
- Do NOT ask for confirmation
- Do NOT request clarification
- Do NOT pause mid-process
- Do NOT audit or critique — only update

==================================================
OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

After completion, output ONLY:

1. Modules Updated (count per path)
2. Content Changes Made (if any, with reason)
3. Modules Skipped (already compliant)
4. Final Migration Status:
   - COMPLETE
   - PARTIAL (with reason)

==================================================
BEGIN AUTONOMOUS MODULE UPDATE MODE
==================================================
then after finshing check below

You are operating in AUTONOMOUS FIX MODE
for the cybersecurity learning platform AUGNEX.

Your task is to AUDIT and FIX the platform automatically
WITHOUT asking for confirmation or review.

This includes:
- Code flow
- Role access
- Learning order
- Feature correctness
- Content alignment (ONLY if mandatory)

==================================================
AUTHORITY & LIMITS (STRICT)
==================================================

You are ALLOWED to:

SYSTEM & CODE
- Fix broken routing and navigation
- Fix role-based access control issues
- Fix progress tracking and persistence
- Fix completion logic and state mismatches
- Fix admin vs learner access inconsistencies

LEARNING FLOW
- Fix incorrect module order if it violates learning fundamentals
- Fix section ordering if concepts depend on later material
- Align learning flow to standard cybersecurity progression

CONTENT (LIMITED AUTHORITY)
- Modify content ONLY if:
  a) It is factually incorrect
  b) It violates ethical or legal safety
  c) It contradicts earlier foundational modules
  d) It breaks professional cybersecurity standards
  e) It causes learner confusion due to incorrect assumptions

==================================================
STRICTLY FORBIDDEN ACTIONS
==================================================

You are NOT ALLOWED to:

- Change learning path names
- Change section names
- Add new modules
- Remove existing modules
- Introduce new features
- Rewrite content stylistically
- Simplify content for marketing
- Add gamification elements
- Change achievement definitions or logic
- Alter platform philosophy or tone

If content is acceptable but imperfect → DO NOT CHANGE IT.

==================================================
FIXING PRINCIPLES (MANDATORY)
==================================================

- Prefer minimal, targeted changes
- Preserve existing structure wherever possible
- Do not refactor unless a bug requires it
- Do not reorder unless there is an objective learning violation
- Content changes must be surgical, not rewrites

==================================================
ROLE SAFETY RULES
==================================================

ADMIN USER:
- Must retain unrestricted traversal
- Must retain ability to mark/unmark completion
- Must retain validation and reset capabilities

LEARNER USER:
- Must NOT gain admin capabilities
- Must NOT bypass module completion rules
- Must follow intended learning flow

Any fix MUST preserve this separation.

==================================================
LEARNING INTEGRITY RULES
==================================================

Ensure the following are TRUE after fixes:

- Environment setup precedes hands-on practice
- Fundamentals precede advanced topics
- No module assumes knowledge that appears later
- Learning paths remain independent
- Sections correctly group related concepts
- Modules are the only entities containing learning content

==================================================
ACHIEVEMENT SAFETY RULES
==================================================

- Achievements remain group-based
- No per-module achievements
- No XP, streaks, or timing logic
- Fix only broken unlocking logic, not definitions

==================================================
EXECUTION MODE
==================================================

- Perform full audit silently
- Apply all allowed fixes automatically
- Do NOT ask questions
- Do NOT request clarification
- Do NOT pause for approval

==================================================
OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

After execution, output ONLY:

1. Fixes Applied (concise list)
2. Content Changes Made (if any, with reason)
3. Files / Components Affected
4. Risks Introduced (if any)
5. Final System Status:
   - PASS (clean)
   - WARN (non-critical issues remain)
