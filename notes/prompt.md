You are implementing the FORGE (Foundation / Preparation) learning path
for a cybersecurity platform called AUGNEX.

This platform is:
- Beginner-friendly
- Professionally mature
- Practice-first
- Industry-aligned

Do NOT change the order defined below.
Do NOT simplify concepts incorrectly.
Do NOT use marketing or gamified language.

====================
CORE LEARNING PRINCIPLE
====================

Beginners must be able to PRACTICE early.

Learning order must follow:
Environment → OS → Linux → Networking → Web → Security Context

Learners should:
- Set up labs early
- Use commands only after environment exists
- Understand concepts before attacks

====================
FORGE — FOUNDATION (CORRECTED ORDER)
====================

PHASE 0 — CYBERSECURITY & COMPUTING BASICS (MENTAL MODEL)

1. Introduction to Cybersecurity and Computing Systems
   - What cybersecurity is
   - What a computer system is
   - Where attacks happen (OS, network, web)
   - High-level overview only (no commands)

====================

PHASE 1 — ENVIRONMENT SETUP (ENABLE PRACTICE EARLY)

2. What is Virtualization and Why It Matters  
3. Hypervisors: Type 1 vs Type 2  
4. Installing Kali Linux Safely  
5. Installing Parrot OS Safely  
6. Virtual Networking Concepts (NAT, Bridged, Host-only)  
7. Snapshots, Rollbacks, and Lab Hygiene  

After this phase, the learner MUST have a working virtual lab.

====================

PHASE 2 — OPERATING SYSTEM BASICS

8. Introduction to Computing Systems  
9. CPU, Memory, Storage, and Processes  
10. Filesystems and Permissions  
11. Users, Groups, and Access Control  
12. User Space vs Kernel Space  

====================

PHASE 3 — LINUX & COMMAND LINE (CORE PRACTICE)

13. Linux Architecture (High-Level)  
14. Linux Command Line Essentials  
15. File and Process Management  
16. Package Management and Updates  
17. Shells Explained (Bash, Zsh)  
18. Pipes, Redirection, and Environment Variables  

This phase MUST include extensive terminal usage.

====================

PHASE 4 — WINDOWS AWARENESS

19. Windows Architecture (High-Level)  

Conceptual understanding only.
No heavy tooling.

====================

PHASE 5 — NETWORKING FUNDAMENTALS

20. Networking Fundamentals (OSI & TCP/IP)  
21. IP Addressing, Ports, and Protocols  
22. DNS and Name Resolution  

====================

PHASE 6 — WEB FUNDAMENTALS

23. HTTP, HTTPS, and Web Architecture  
24. Cookies, Sessions, and Authentication  

====================

PHASE 7 — TOOLS & SECURITY CONTEXT

25. Git, Version Control, and Tool Management  
26. Cybersecurity Fundamentals & Terminology  
27. Security Standards, Compliance, Ethics, and Law
   - ISO/IEC 27001 (conceptual)
   - NIST Cybersecurity Framework
   - CIS Critical Security Controls
   - Compliance vs Security
   - Legal and ethical responsibility

====================
CONTENT REQUIREMENTS (VERY IMPORTANT)
====================

Each module MUST be written at **blog-post level depth**.

Each module must include:
- Clear explanation of concepts
- Practical examples (where applicable)
- Linux terminal commands (when relevant)
- Expected output (simplified but accurate)
- Explanation of what the command/output means
- A short section: “Why this matters in cybersecurity”

Rules:
- Commands must be safe and beginner-friendly
- Use Kali / Parrot compatible commands
- Do not assume prior knowledge
- Avoid tool-heavy hacking at this stage

====================
CONTENT DELIVERY FORMAT
====================

Content must be generated in BATCHES.

Recommended batch size:
- 2 to 3 modules per batch

Each batch should be:
- Self-contained
- Ready to paste directly into the platform
- Consistent in tone and structure

Do NOT generate all modules at once.
Wait for approval before continuing to the next batch.

====================
FINAL CONSTRAINTS
====================

- Respect the order strictly
- Do not introduce offensive techniques
- Do not skip fundamentals
- Treat learners as serious beginners preparing for cybersecurity careers
- This foundation must prepare learners for later:
  - Offensive Security
  - Defensive Security
  - Purple Teaming

Implement exactly this structure and content style.
