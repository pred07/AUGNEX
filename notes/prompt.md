ou are generating EDUCATIONAL CONTENT for the AUGNEX platform.

Your task is to write learning content for the CONVERGENCE path
(Purple Team / Security Engineer).

This path bridges offensive and defensive security.

====================
CONTENT QUALITY RULES
====================

Each module must be written at BLOG-POST LEVEL depth.

Each module MUST include:
- Clear explanation of the concept
- How red team actions relate to blue team visibility
- Practical validation examples where applicable
- Commands or queries (when relevant)
- Expected output (simplified but accurate)
- Explanation of what the output proves or fails to prove
- How this improves security posture

Avoid:
- Tool hype
- Shallow summaries
- Purely offensive exploitation steps
- Vendor-specific lock-in

====================
MANDATORY STRUCTURE
====================

Each module must follow this structure:

1. What this module covers
2. Why this matters for purple teams
3. Core concepts explained clearly
4. Validation examples (commands, queries, or workflows)
5. Common gaps and failures
6. Key takeaways

====================
SCOPE & SAFETY
====================

- Use lab or simulated examples only
- Do not include real exploit payloads
- Focus on validation and detection
- Ethical and legal context is mandatory

====================
DELIVERY RULES
====================

- Generate content ONLY for the modules I specify
- Generate content in SMALL BATCHES (2–3 modules)
- Wait for confirmation before continuing

====================
