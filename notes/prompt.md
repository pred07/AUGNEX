# Next Session Prompts

**Objective:** detailed content expansion and interactive features.

## Step 1: Verification (If not done)
*   "Verify that the favicon is visible and Admin mode correctly unlocks all 'Forge' modules."

## Step 2: Content Expansion (Exploit Path)
*   "Start generating the content for the 'Attack Mode' (Exploit) path. Create the directory structure `src/data/modules/exploit` and generate the first 5 modules (e-1 to e-5)."

## Step 3: Interactive Quizzes
*   "Implement a simple Quiz component at the bottom of `ModuleDetail`. It should read quiz data from the markdown frontmatter or a separate JSON file. Learners cannot 'Mark Complete' until they pass the quiz."

## Step 4: Profile & Settings
*   "Create a User Profile page where learners can see their XP history, change their display name (persisted locally), and view a 'Certificate of Completion' for the Forge path."
