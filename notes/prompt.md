# Next Session Prompts

**Objective:** Interactive Quizzes and Content Expansion.

## Step 1: Verification (Mobile)
*   "Verify the mobile layout on your device or emulator. Check the Bottom Nav and ensure 'Mark Complete' is accessible."

## Step 2: Interactive Quizzes
*   "Implement the `QuizComponent` in `src/components/QuizComponent.jsx`. It should take a list of questions (from frontmatter or separate JSON). Use the 'Red/Black' neon aesthetic. Users must score 80% to mark the module as complete."

## Step 3: Content Expansion (Exploit Path)
*   "Start generating the content for the 'Attack Mode' (Exploit) path. Create `src/data/modules/e-1.md` through `e-5.md` focused on Web Exploitation Fundamentals."

## Step 4: User Profile
*   "Enhance the User Profile page to show a heatmap of activity (GitHub style) and a list of unlocked badges."
